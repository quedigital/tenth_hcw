// UI DESIGN: come up with exterior framework / navigation / spread loading
// UI DESIGN: retina images?  (Cloudinary can downsample for us: http://res.cloudinary.com/hcw10/image/upload/w_0.5/v1406726724/10_1/image1.png)
//            or you can set a pixel ratio in Cloudinary or use their plugin and .cloudinary_update();
// UI DESIGN: or use SVG for most non-raster images? (IE9+)
// CODE DESIGN: decide whether to load from json or from processed HTML/Javascript

// DONE: add a handle for the resizable
// DONE: view one spread at a time, selectable from list
// DONE: don't hard-code variable "cm"

// DONE: steps nicely set off in panels or wells
// DONE: textarea sized to fit
// DONE: custom fields for grid or fixed layouts (using knockout if binding)
// DONE: variable properties nicely formatted in a grid or table
// DONE: navbar for spread and layout info
// DONE: put "grid / fixed" field in content or layout – NOT BOTH
// BUG_FIXED: "grid / fixed" select keeps resetting, upon page reload, to the first option?! (first on the content side, now on the layout side... strange!) [valueAllowUnset seemed to do the trick]
// DONE: image placement as a 9-box selectable grid widget
// TODONT: move all image references to layout (nah)
// IGNORE: getVariableProperties doesn't work when updating values (yes, I think it does; well, not now it doesn't; obviated)
// DONE: ability to add extra properties [generic "styling" text area]
// DONE: fixed layout anchor point UI [in properties table]
// DONE: handle glossary terms (ie, bold) within text
// DONE: add class name to callouts [theme field]
// DONE: "glossary" style button
// DONE: show currently selected spread
// DONE: sidebar add and delete spreads
// DONE: rename editor.js spread instance to something like Editor
// DONE: ability to add step
// DONE: put marginLeft (for grid layout) into the property panel
// DONE: standardize anchor values
// DONE: make sure new cell id's are unique (using max id + 1)
// DONE: when adding/deleting cells, sync layout hints
// DONE: re-order cells
// DONE: when updating hint id's via textbox, update the necessary data("id") as well
// DONE: update sidebar list when a spread gets deleted (and added and modified)
// DONE: also add/delete corresponding layout when spread gets added/deleted
// DONE: export to json (server side process that will let us download the json output -- not necessary!)
// DONE: backup and undo capability
// DONE: use human-readable cell names
// DONE: load published pages from json
// DONE: make callouts open with mouse over (desktop)
// DONE: animate fading away of expanded box on Fixed Layout
// DONE: tap doesn't show highlight on fixed layout (iPad)
// DONE: remove 300ms click delay (iPad) –> use touchend not click
// DONE: tap to toggle highlights (iPad)
// DONE: image uploading (Firebase server?) with resizing? [using Cloudinary]
// DONE: fix https/http warning between Cloudinary and Firebase
// DONE: refactor the callouts so the same one is used for fixed and grid layouts?
// DONE: make the "player" show the new-style grid layouts correctly
// DONE: sort spread list by chapter and number
// DONE: refactor the grid layout code so it's in one place (a new Common directory?) [somewhat: common/js/Helpers.js for findSpace, reserveSpace]
// DONE: layouts for cells with images should have position checkboxes
// DONE: load json from Cloudinary
// DONE: "interactive" cell type
// DONE: "publish spread" checkbox
// DONE: video widget
// DONE: background color for each spread
// DONE: find a way to make Amazon AWS bucket items public via Javascript
// TODONT: export json to Cloudinary [used Amazon via Google instead]

// DONE: make publish order match editor order
// DONE: steps allowed without numbers
// DONE: change text color
// DONE: change % of width for images accompanying text
// DONE: position step images
// DONE: layout boxes aren't allowed to overlap [might not be the most robust solution]
// DONE: abandon the idea of leaving grid cell's row and column sometimes blank?  (ie, fill them in all the time)
// DONE: match content order with layout order
// DONE: save images to AWS S3?
// DONE: sidebar with chapter groupings
// DONE: make sure sidebar text changes still work
// DONE: different sidebar icons for each spread type
// DONE: only retain 20 or so version histories in the menu (but allow permanent "checkpoints"? -> use Publish for major checkpoints; they're stored by Amazon)
// DONE: clicking on layout hint scrolls to corresponding content cell (also in Fixed layouts)
// DONE: delete hint when cell is deleted
// DONE: changing cell order doesn't seem to be working
// DONE: cell heading
// DONE: hints shouldn't jump over other hints when re-stacking (I don't think) and maybe they shouldn't restack at all, just get out of the way of the dragging cell? (so: one temporary "spacer" row?)
// DONE: invert color of step number blocks on dark backgrounds
// DONE: optimize the loading of the spread sidebar [as best I could think of; still very slow and repetitive]
// DONE: search in spread sidebar
// DONE: spread pane doesn't always load or refresh (spreadList.doRebuild() makes it show up, so it's probably a timing issue) [domReady issue, I think]
// DONE: callout lines
// DONE: callout line target selection dialog
// DONE: select a content cell selects / highlights the layout cell
// DONE: changing content id needs to also change layout id [ok, but you need to reload the spread for the new id's to be reflected everywhere]
// DONE: callouts per image
// DONE: size cell images (so they're not huge by default?)
// DONE: callout line pop-up dialog needs to size to fit image
// DONE: indicator for cells with callout lines
// DONE: fixed layout cells aren't staying put (SVG's don't have "width" so scaling issue)
// DONE: set callout line targets by clicking
// DONE: don't load all spreads at once (obviously!) – bottom TOC? horizontal swiping?
// DONE: throttle the menu loading (since it's so repetitive)
// DONE: selecting layout cells is no longer scrolling to selected cell
// DONE: make selecting content cell itself count as selecting that cell
// DONE: refactor callout lines so they can be shared by grid and fixed layouts
// DONE: for Fixed Layout steps, calculate the expanded/unexpanded positions and sizes on page load, not on click (or cache it at least)
// DONE: make gridder and fixer classes derive from same parent
// DONE: callout lines for callouts without .block (ie, .diamond or unnumbered steps) [falls back to .diamond, .textblock]
// DONE: resize when window resizes
// DONE: callout lines match text color
// DONE: added smooth scrolling for iPad (using css not iScroll because it didn't zoom-in-place well)
// DONE: UI DESIGN: leave pinch-zooming enabled?
// DONE: renamed "callout" boxes "sidebar"
// DONE: used iNobounce to eliminate iOS page bouncing
// DONE: animate callout lines as they scroll into view?
// DONE: highlight step number before callout line animates out
// DONE: open to random spread (for quality control review purposes)
// DONE: fixed layouts need to fit the pane (and centered)
// DONE: fixed layouts need next/prev buttons
// DONE: advance to next/prev spread by scrolling
