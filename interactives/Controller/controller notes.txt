-I imagined those as hit buttons, like what would appear when the button is already
pressed. I personally like the kind of interactivity that allows the user to explore the 
page for the buttons, which could be indicated by the arrow simply turning into 
a pointing finger.

-the rubble sprite is the only one that is not transparent because I wanted the 
controller and motors to shake. I can position the motors in the right place and then 
use the xray_controller_noMotor image as the base for the x-ray view so the motors.png
image can act as a button.
