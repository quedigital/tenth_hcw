CB> Maybe the X-ray image shouldn't include the yellow arrows, etc. (they should come from the individual animation sprites)

action (triangle) button:
- closed & open: (180, 48, 18)
- notes: the open circuit always be playing with user views X-ray view of controller, 
  closed is the animation that would play when the action button is pressed

up button (147, 73, 48)
right button (105, 103, 48)

CB> Is there a reason rightcircuit_spritesheet.png has the black circuit and part of the yellow arrow embedded in it?
KH> I overwrote the files and had to erase each frame by hand, I can fix the black circuit but I didnâ€™t think the yellow arrow would be a big problem.

-I imagined those as hit buttons, like what would appear when the button is already
pressed. I personally like the kind of interactivity that allows the user to explore the 
page for the buttons, which could be indicated by the arrow simply turning into 
a pointing finger.

CB> The trouble with mouse pointers is they don't work the iPad
KH> Ah, I keep forgetting.

-the rubble sprite is the only one that is not transparent because I wanted the 
controller and motors to shake. I can position the motors in the right place and then 
use the xray_controller_noMotor image as the base for the x-ray view so the motors.png
image can act as a button.
