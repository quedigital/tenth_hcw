In such <span class='glossary'>conductive</span> materials, electrons jump freely from one atom to another under the right circumstances. This movement of electrons is <span class='glossary'>electricity</span>. In other materials, such as rubber and glass, electrons are more closely bound to their nuclei and do not easily move from one atom to another. These <span class='glossary'>nonconductive</span> materials are <span class='glossary'>insulators</span>. Still other materials, such as silicon, can act as either conductors or nonconductors under different conditions.

Static on the radio and snow on a television screen are tangible examples of electrical noise. Much of the electromechanical design of computer components, such as adding nonfunctioning wires to cables, is aimed at reducing the interference of noise. The noisier the environment, the stronger a signal must be to make itself heard over the noise. And the stronger a signal, the more noise it creates that affect other components.",

The amount of data that a signal can carry increases with the frequency of the electromagnetic field creating them. Because there are more variations in one second of higher frequency waves, there are more opportunities to modulate the wave so that it carries data.",
