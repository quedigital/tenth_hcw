You say a hard drive uses a magnet to write files, but then you’re obligated to explain why. And then you have to say why magnets attract certain metals. And then explain why magnets have these invisible force fields.&lt;/p&gt;</div><div>&lt;p&gt;And don’t expect your computer to explain itself. It maintains a Sphinx-like silence. Shouldn’t there be doodads and thingamajigs that are pumping or swinging, flashing or beeping, vibrating or rotating, at least ticking or tocking? For all you can tell about how your computer works from opening it up and looking inside, your computer might as well be carved out of soap.&lt;/p&gt;</div><div>&lt;p&gt;In your computer, the things that really make it all work are ghosts. You never see them. You see only what they do—like a lamp thrown to the floor by a poltergeist. And computers, from PCs to a Galaxy S phone, tightly tuck away their secrets. You have to keep asking “Why?” And if you ask long enough, you get into physical states filled with objects so small you can’t see them, or that exist only in ghostly states, such as the vast parts of the electromagnetic spectrum or some screwy spinning quantum string, all of which are invisible to mere humans.&lt;/p&gt;</div><div>&lt;p&gt;The only way to even get a hint about what these little ghosts are like is to fling them around in giant, mile-wide magnets like the Large Hadron Collider, until they smash into each other and create even smaller, rarer ghosts that vanish as soon as they appear. We’re just left with only the contrails they leave behind, and from those we try to figure out what just happened.&lt;/p&gt;</div><div>&lt;p&gt;These little, invisible ghosts are the ultimate things—the “tiny invisible 1s and 0s,” as Doyen says. The ghostly little digital LEGOs that unite in different combinations to create everything in your computer, tablet, or smartphone. To understand—really understand—how a microprocessor or monitor or printer works, you have to understand the ghostly workings of electricity, waves, magnetism, binary math, and data packets.&lt;/p&gt;</div><div>&lt;p&gt;So let’s examine them all. Don’t be frightened. They’re friendly ghosts…I think.&lt;/p&gt;</div><div>&lt;/section&gt;</div>","type":"step",".priority":1}},"chapter":"1","number":"0","part":1,"title":"The Ghostly LEGOs of Computing","type":"grid"},"0_1":{"cells":{"1":{"id":1,"text":"<div><span>&lt;h1&gt;About This Book&lt;/h1&gt;</span></div><div><span>&lt;blockquote&gt;</span><br></div><span>&lt;p&gt;</span>Any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic.<span>&lt;/p&gt;&lt;footer&gt;</span><div>&lt;cite&gt;<span>Arthur C.

Witches have their familiars—creatures disguised as household beasts that could, if they choose, wreak the witches’ havoc. Mystics have their golems—beings built of wood and tin brought to life to do their masters’ bidding.&lt;/p&gt;</span></div><div>&lt;p&gt;We have our personal computers.&lt;/p&gt;</div><div>&lt;p&gt;PCs, too, are powerful creations that often seem to have a life of their own. Usually, they respond to a wave of a mouse or a spoken incantation by performing tasks we couldn’t imagine doing ourselves without some sort of preternatural help. But even as computers successfully carry out our commands, it’s often difficult to quell the feeling that there’s some wizardry at work here.&lt;/p&gt;</div><div>&lt;p&gt;And then there are the times when our PCs, like malevolent spirits, rebel and open the gates of chaos onto our neatly ordered columns of numbers, our carefully wrought sentences, and our beautifully crafted graphics. When that happens, we’re often convinced that we are, indeed, playing with power not entirely under our control. We become sorcerers’ apprentices, whose every attempt to right things leads to deeper trouble.&lt;/p&gt;</div><div>&lt;p&gt;Whether our personal computers are faithful servants or imps, most of us soon realize there’s much more going on inside those silent boxes than we really understand. PCs are secretive. Open their tightly sealed cases and you’re confronted with poker-faced components. Few give any clues as to what they’re about. Most of them consist of sphinx-like microchips that offer no more information about themselves than some obscure code printed on their impenetrable surfaces. The maze of circuit tracings etched on the boards is fascinating, but meaningless, hieroglyphics. Some crucial parts, such as the hard drive and power supply, are sealed with printed omens about the dangers of peeking inside—omens that put to shame the warnings on a pharaoh’s tomb.&lt;/p&gt;</div><div>&lt;p&gt;This book is based on two ideas. One is that the magic we understand is safer and more powerful than the magic we don’t. This is not a hands-on how-to book. Don’t look for any instructions for taking a screwdriver to this part or the other. But perhaps your knowing more about what’s going on inside all those stoic components makes them a little less formidable when something does go awry. The second idea behind this book is that knowledge, in itself, is a worthwhile and enjoyable goal. This book is written to respond to your random musings about the goings-on inside that box you sit in front of several hours a day. If this book puts your questions to rest—or raises new ones—it will have done its job.&lt;/p&gt;</div><div>&lt;p&gt;At the same time, however, I’m trusting that knowing the secrets behind the magician’s legerdemain won’t spoil the show. This is a real danger. Mystery is often as compelling as knowledge. I’d hate to think that anything you read in this book takes away that sense of wonder you have when you manage to make your PC do some grand, new trick. I hope that, instead, this book makes you a more confident sorcerer.&lt;/p&gt;</div><div>&lt;/section&gt;</div><div><div style=\"line-height: 25.2000007629395px;\">&lt;blockquote&gt;<br></div><span style=\"line-height: 25.2000007629395px;\">&lt;p&gt;</span><span style=\"line-height: 25.2000007629395px;\">For Shannon and Michael, who always asked, “Why?” And Sue, who asked “Why Not?”</span><span style=\"line-height: 25.2000007629395px;\">&lt;/p&gt;&lt;footer&gt;</span><div style=\"line-height: 25.2000007629395px;\">&lt;cite&gt;Ron&lt;/cite&gt;</div><div><div style=\"line-height: 25.2000007629395px;\">&lt;/footer&gt;</div><div style=\"line-height: 25.2000007629395px;\">&lt;/blockquote&gt;</div><div><div style=\"line-height: 25.2000007629395px;\">&lt;blockquote&gt;<br></div><span style=\"line-height: 25.2000007629395px;\">&lt;p&gt;For my mother, Lillian, whose tireless work ethic and uncompromising dedication to quality has inspired me all of my life.

He’s been a computer columnist for Windows Sources and 80 Micro.&nbsp;<i>How Computers Work</i>&nbsp;was named best nonfiction computer book, and his writing has been honored by the Maggie Awards, the Robert F.

Tim has been involved in all facets of graphic design in his illustrious career. From illustrator to creative director, Tim has led teams of artists and designers in advertising agencies, marketing communications firms, and consumer magazines to better tell their stories through illustration, photography, typography, and design. “Our job doesn’t start when the writer hits Save. In order to effectively communicate the tone or the concept of the piece, we need to know and understand the story from the original brainstorm all the way through final execution,” reminds Tim.&lt;/p&gt;</div><div style=\"line-height: 25.2000007629395px;\">&lt;p&gt;Examples of Tim’s design, illustration, and photographic work can be seen at &lt;a href=\"<span style=\"line-height: 25.2000007629395px;\">http://timothyedwarddowns.com\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;</span><span style=\"line-height: 25.2000007629395px;\">timothyedwarddowns.com&lt;/a&gt;.</span></div><div style=\"line-height: 25.2000007629395px;\"><span style=\"line-height: 25.2000007629395px;\">&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/section&gt;</span></div><div style=\"line-height: 25.2000007629395px;\"><span style=\"line-height: 25.2000007629395px;\">&lt;section&gt;</span></div><div><span style=\"line-height: 25.2000007629395px;\">&lt;h1&gt;Acknowledgements&lt;/h1&gt;</span><div><div style=\"line-height: 25.2000007629395px;\">&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=\"init-cap-words\"&gt;You can't write&lt;/span&gt; 10 versions of the same book over a span of 20 years without a lot of help from a lot of people. This book certainly couldn’t have been done without Tim Downs. His illustrations have set a new standard for technical art. And art is the word. Not only is he always careful to make sure his illustrations are correct technically, he has imbued them with his talent to make them works of art that could stand alone outside of this book’s technical explanations. We’ve worked together for 20 years, and I’m happy that unlike some other partnerships I’ve entered into, I continue to think of Tim as not just an illustrator, but a dear friend.&lt;/p&gt;</div><div style=\"line-height: 25.2000007629395px;\">&lt;p&gt;This particular edition could not have been done without the aid of some others. My wife, Sue, has served as editor, critic, coach, and personal trainer. I know that the time I’ve spent in front of a keyboard was not always pleasant for either of us. But when I felt like chucking it all, Sue was there, helping me in the ways I needed most. Our son, Michael White, also spent hours helping with tedious research and checking for errors, despite running his own business and returning to the classroom. Thank you, both.&lt;/p&gt;</div><div style=\"line-height: 25.2000007629395px;\">&lt;p&gt;It’s not fashionable among many writers to heap praise on their editors and publishers. But I can’t heap enough on my editor, Todd Brakke, and Que Publisher Greg Wiegand. In this and other editions, Todd has been the editor all writers want, ever ready with unerringly good suggestions, encouragement, and lending a hand with the words when time was pressing. Greg has always seemed more like a friend than someone who hired me to write still another edition. When I was ill during the course of writing this, his concern was for my health, not the deadlines I missed. Thank you, guys.&lt;/p&gt;</div><div style=\"line-height: 25.2000007629395px;\">&lt;p&gt;I’m indebted to other editors who gave me the foundations to write. Roddy Stinson taught me the importance of listening to my own voice. Jim Dolan showed me how every detail matters. The late Jim Seymour, who was the editor-in-chief of&nbsp;<i>PC Computing</i>&nbsp;when it was launched in 1988, and his wife Nora, who was editor, gave me the opportunity to jump from newspaper to magazines, and were exceptional, warm friends. Preston Gralla guided me in setting up a How It Works section when I joined PCC. This book wouldn’t be here without him, and I can never thank him enough for a friendship and too many acts of kindness to list.&lt;/p&gt;</div><div style=\"line-height: 25.2000007629395px;\">&lt;p&gt;l owe a huge debt to Mike Edelhart, who was editor-in-chief and publisher of&nbsp;<i>PC Computing</i>&nbsp;and who convinced a then dubious book publisher to take a chance on a kind of computer book that had never been done before. Deep thanks go to Randy Ross, Margaret Ficklen, Herb Brody, Brett L. Glass, Marty Jerome, Raymond Jones, Matthew Lake, Jack Nimersheim, Stephen Sagman, Jan Smith, Dylan Tweney, Doug van Kirk, Mark L. Van Name, Bill Catchings, Christine Grech Wendin, and Kenan Woods, all of whom helped in earlier editions.&lt;/p&gt;</div><div style=\"line-height: 25.2000007629395px;\">&lt;p&gt;Thanks to editors now and over the course of nine editions: Rick Kughen, Stephanie McComb, Tonya Simpson, Nick Goetz, Angelina Ward, Sarah Robbins, Cindy Hudson, Melinda Levine, Lysa Lewallen, Renee Wilmeth, and Leah Kirkpatrick for pulling everything together. Juliet Langley pushed the first edition to book sellers with such fervor I doubt it could ever have been a success without her.&lt;/p&gt;</div><div style=\"line-height: 25.2000007629395px;\">&lt;p&gt;I’m also grateful to the dozens of people in the PC industry who’ve shared their knowledge, schematics, and white papers to infuse&nbsp;<i>How Computers Work</i>&nbsp;with detail and accuracy. I’m particularly grateful to Ray Soneira, author of Sonera Technologies’ DisplayMate and the person who knows more about display technology than anyone else in the world; Griffin Lemaster of Creative Electron; Chris Thornton of ClipMate; Karen Thomas at Olympus; Joe Vanderwater, Bryan Langerdoff, Dan Francisco, Tami Casey, John Hyde, Bill Kircos, Susan Shaw, and Seth Walker at Intel; Russell Sanchez and Adam Kahn of Microsoft; Jim Bartlett, Ellen Reid Smith, Tim Kearns, and Desire Russell at IBM; Barrett Anderson and Todd Hollinshead at id Software; Marcie Pedrazzi of Adaptec; Eileen Algaze at Rockwell; A.J.

If there are any mistakes in this book, I can’t lay the blame on them.&lt;/p&gt;</div><div style=\"line-height: 25.2000007629395px;\">&lt;p&gt;As this may be the last edition of the book I work on, I want to thank all the readers for their kind comments, spotting errors, and, of course, shelling out money to buy it.

Computers were relatively new, and they were all pretty much the same. There were only two important differences—whether a computer was an Apple or a Wintel, that is, running Windows on an Intel processor. There were some variations in size, portability, and the customization enthusiasts could do by installing different drives and expansion boards inside PCs. Stuffing the newest-fangled components into my computer at PC Computing, the magazine where I worked, was a wonderful pastime and the source of many stories in the magazine. If I made a mistake and the computer groaned its last breath, that often made for an even better story.&lt;/p&gt;</span></div><div>&lt;p&gt;One reason PC disasters made for good reading is that every computer user had a similar story of computer disaster. We were all in the same boat because even the editors of computer magazines—if the truth be told—didn’t know what they were doing a lot of the time. Back then if you took a class on computers in college, you waited your turn to run a program on some monster of a computer that would return a solution in the form of punch cards. There was no formal place to go to learn about personal computers. Manuals were useless beyond finding out how to plug a PC into the wall and where the switch was located. Programs that worked one way had no resemblance to how other programs worked. You learned about computers by trial and error, by going to user groups made up of equally befuddled PC owners, and by reading magazines.&lt;/p&gt;</div><div>&lt;p&gt;Before I went to work for <i>PC Computing</i> in 1989, my teachers were <i>PC Magazine</i>, <i>PC World</i>, <i>Byte</i>, <i>Popular Computing</i>, and other magazines covering this new technical phenomenon. You found a morsel of information in one magazine, a nugget in another, and eventually you pieced together what was going on inside that steel box on your desktop.&lt;/p&gt;</div><div>&lt;p&gt;But I was going to tell why it was easier to write this book 20 years ago. Back then, you could say all someone needed to know about a floppy disk in a couple of two-page spreads. Something as mind-busting and intricate as a monitor you could do with one illustration. The technology was, in retrospect, elementary. How computers and their components worked was actually simple when you sketched it all out and added some callouts and arrows. No wonder I figured I could, with the help of a great illustrator like Timothy Edward Downs, write a book that laid out for all to see the mysteries of what really is a fascinating technology.&lt;/p&gt;</div><div>&lt;p&gt;But today? Lord love a duck! Today there’s not even a simple explanation of what a computer is. Simply having a microchip doesn’t cut it. Microchips are everywhere, in watches, cars, thermostats, ovens, refrigerators, flashlights, dog collars, coffee pots—just about anything that uses electricity. But these aren’t computers. They’re just electronic doo-dads that use the abilities of microprocessors to perform routine chores.&lt;/p&gt;</div><div>&lt;p&gt;To be a computer, something must be programmable. It must be capable of doing different things based on the instructions you give it. Your yard’s sprinkler system is a computer. True, it doesn’t do a lot of different things, but you can program it to water different parts of your yard for different lengths of time, and on different days, or not at all if it’s raining. Microwave ovens are computers you use by programming it on the fly by setting how long it will cook at different temperatures, or you can push a Popcorn button to tell the oven to use a preprogrammed sequence.&lt;/p&gt;</div><div>&lt;p&gt;These are all computers, but the truth is they’re not very interesting. How deeply do you care how your sprinkler works? But a computer that can be programed to do so… many… different… things— now, that is a computer worthy of the name, and we see them everywhere today. Phones, cameras, tablets, music players, and TVs have all become computers that are indispensable parts of everyday life. Our lives are richer for the knowledge, problem solving, communication, entertainment, health, and income they provide.&lt;/p&gt;</div><div>&lt;p&gt;They certainly deserve to be included in a book that calls itself How Computers Work. The problem— my problem anyway—is that they make organizing a book like this an exercise in controlled chaos. In previous editions, I simply had a section on storage, another section on displays, one on networking…. I admit that in this edition I’ve fallen back on that system in some chapters out of pure convenience. But generally the workings of today’s computers are not so compartmentalized. The more I looked at computing over the last 20 years, the more it struck me that the real story of how computers work is how they are like living creatures, organisms that have evolved and continue to evolve. These metal and silicon and plastic and glass animals have followed the same patterns of mutation, natural selection and survival of the fittest that Darwin found in plants and animals.&lt;/p&gt;</div><div>&lt;p&gt;I’ve tried to explain how technological developments follow the same rise and fall that carry organic species to new shores. Today’s achievements in computing are possible only because they rise out of the fossil beds of earlier technology. There is no way for today’s technology to have been invented from scratch. I recall that some 30 years ago, I was working for a computing service company that relied on mainframes, an obsolete term to describe computers the size of a couple of high-end refrigerators slammed together. They used two kinds of storage: hard drives and magnetic tape. The 5 megabyte hard drives were the size of large garbage cans, and the platters where information was stored could have doubled as hub caps. You had to have seen the magnetic tape at work to understand one of computer’s most common terms: RAM—random access memory. It sounds as if data is retrieved willy-nilly from all different parts of memory chips with no order system to it. Memory chips got their RAM moniker because retrieving tape memory was not random. If you wanted data stored on a reel at the innermost 10 inches of tape, the computer had to wind through the first 3,590 feet to get to that data.&lt;/p&gt;</div><div>&lt;p&gt;Sure, it would have been better to skip tape altogether and go straight to hard disks. But to paraphrase a certain infamous quote, sometimes you don’t build computers with the technology you wish you had; you build them with the technology you have.&lt;/p&gt;</div><div>&lt;p&gt;Life in the primordial seas had to get the hang of existence as one-celled organisms before the cells could master hooking together and dividing up the jobs needed for mutual survival. Some of those bigger organisms learned to move by wiggling. They developed a way to filter oxygen from water, and later that system developed into lungs that could suck oxygen out of water. It took millions of years for these changes to evolve. You couldn’t create magnetic disks until you’d learned how to record data to magnetic tape. Then it took years of engineers trying first this and then that to make the disks smaller and at the same time more capacious. Current solid state drives come from the fossils of technological forays, such as bubble memory, that didn’t survive.&lt;/p&gt;</div><div>&lt;p&gt;The most amazing aspect of this whirlwind of technical progress is that it’s only taken 20 years to go from floppy to solid state, from displays that amounted to stick figures to animated graphics that are almost indistinguishable from film images. That smartphone in your pocket has more computing power than those refrigerator-sized mainframes. The wires that have been needed for communications for a century are likely to disappear completely in the next 10 years, along with the need for local data storage. It’s possible the keyboard and mouse will become extinct. In fact much of the hardware we’re used to today, as its gets smaller and more efficient, may migrate from our desks and our pockets to become parts of our eyes, ears, and brain.&lt;/p&gt;</div><div>&lt;p&gt;And that’s just in the next 20 years. Beyond that we can’t imagine what will become of technology any more than one-celled organisms could have imaged a dinosaur. Let’s check back with each other after a couple of decades and then see what may be possible.&lt;/p&gt;</div><div>&lt;p class=\"signature\"&gt;<span>Ron White&lt;br/&gt;</span><span>San Antonio, TX&lt;/p&gt;</span></div><div><span>&lt;/section&gt;</span></div>","type":"text",".priority":1}},"chapter":"0","number":2,"part":"0","title":"Introduction to the Tenth Edition"},"0_3":{"cells":{"1":{"id":1,"image":"","text":"What you are reading right now is a new thing, an evolution of the way we publish and disseminate information.

The first clocks were not small things. These clocks, which first appeared in the 16th century B.C. in Babylon and Egypt, ranged from desk size to house size. In their simplest form, a bowl with a hole in the bottom was filled with water. The water slowly dripped through the hole, filling a container below it. As the water rose in the container, a float rose with it. A pointer on the float indicated the time using a series of markings on the inside of the container.&lt;/p&gt;</div><div>&lt;figure class=\"right\"&gt;</div><div><span>&lt;img src=\"</span>s3/images/10_0/1000_fig01.png<span>\"</span><span>/&gt;</span><br></div><div><span>&lt;figcaption&gt;</span>A life-sized model of a 1434 A.D. Korean water clock known as Jagyeongnu, on display at The National Palace Museum of Korea.

An indicator of how inaccurate a clepsydra was is the fact that a sundial was used to make corrections in the water clock’s time-keeping. Attempts to improve its accuracy usually involved adding more leaking water bowls until it came to weigh several hundred pounds, which is much too heavy for most wrists.&lt;/p&gt;</div><div>&lt;p&gt;It wasn’t until 1250 A.D. that a mechanical mutation came along to change all that. It was a very small and very simple device that would revolutionize time-keeping, and it is still in use today. It’s called the &lt;span class=\"bold\"&gt;escapement&lt;/span&gt;.

A shaft from the wheel connects to a system of gears to turn the hands of a clock. The piece just above the wheel—called the &lt;span class=\"bold\"&gt;anchor&lt;/span&gt;— has two &lt;span class=\"bold\"&gt;catch hooks&lt;/span&gt; on either end. The job of the anchor is to rock back and forth, stopping the wheel momentarily by catching one of its spikes. The wheel then bounces back enough to throw off the first hook and turns a bit before the second catch hook descends to stop the wheel from the other side. The sounds made by one and then the other of the hooks stopping the wheel is the origin of &lt;span class=\"italic\"&gt;tick-tock&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</div><div><span>&lt;p&gt;The escapement is a small thing, but consider what it has made possible in commerce, travel, factories, science, and worrying where your children are at this hour.&lt;/p&gt;</span></div><div><span>&lt;p&gt;Similarly, many innovations in computing have had an effect far out of proportion to their physical size.

Computer makers and users realized these mobile gadgets were more than office appliances or at-home game machines. They could give us the power to be interconnected, all the time.

Computing allows us to create and listen to music made with sounds we—the world—had never heard before, and our favorite apps know what music we’d like before we know. Capturing electromagnetic waves millions of years old, from galaxies millions of light years away, gives us fantastic images in glowing colors with a cast of billions of stars, the existence of which we could only guess at before computing came along.

In response, President Eisenhower created the Advanced Research Projects Agency (ARPA) within the Department of Defense (DoD) to get the U.S. into space (and to boost military missile development). That role was replaced by NASA, and ARPA redefined itself as a sponsor of advanced research projects at various universities and contractors.&lt;/p&gt;</div><div>&lt;p&gt;In late 1960, Paul Baran of the RAND Corporation wrote a series of technical papers for the Pentagon analyzing the vulnerability of communications in case of a Soviet nuclear attack.

They came up with the idea of a distributed network called ARPAnet, built around something called interface message processor (IMP), which connected computers at university research centers. IMP also incorporated a technology called TCP/ IP, developed at the National Science Foundation. Standing for transmission control protocol/Internet protocol, TCP/IP calls for breaking up messages and data into packets to which addressing information, error correction code, and identification are added. The packets can all travel to their destinations over the distributed network, and a computer on the other end checks for mistakes and pieces them together in the right order. In 1969, computers at universities all over the country were linked to ARPAnet.

By 1975, one new installation was being added each month. Meanwhile, other types of networks, such as the Computer Science Network (CSNET), designed to be a less-expensive version of ARPAnet, sprang up across the country. In 1974, researcher Bob Kahn and Vint Cerf came up with the idea of a “network of networks” that would let dissimilar networks communicate with one another. By 1982, different networks were adopting TCP/IP as their communications standard, and the term “Internet” was used for the first time.

For years, the Internet was the territory of colleges and defense contractors. As the Internet grew, many of the people who nursed it through its infancy were dismayed when, in 1991, the NSF lifted restrictions on the commercial use of the Net.</span>&lt;/p&gt;</div><div><span>&lt;figure class=\"right\"&gt;</span></div><div><span>&lt;img src=\"</span><span>s3/images/17_-1/part05fig02.png</span><span>\"</span><span>/&gt;</span><br></div><div><span>&lt;figcaption&gt;</span>The first Internet message, although probably no one at the time realized it, was duly noted in a handwritten log at UCLA on Oct. 29, 1969.&lt;/figcaption&gt;</div><div>&lt;/figure&gt;</div><div><span>&lt;p&gt;</span><span>The first time someone sent out advertising over the Internet—a practice destined to earn the name spam—elicited reactions among Internet purists that were angry and vocal.

Being a system without physical limitations, it’s theoretically possible for the Net to include all information on all computers everywhere, which in this age means essentially everything the human race knows (or thinks it knows). But because the Net is such an ad-hoc system, exploring it can be a challenge. And you don’t always find exactly what you want. There are still multiple “standards” that browser, Web designer, and hardware developers quarrel over, and some who strike out on their own convinced they have the one, true design for the Internet to follow. The result is that when you jump into the Internet, you’re pretty much on your own. With experience, you learn the tricks and secrets buried in browsers, websites, and the Web’s bottom feeders—spam, viruses, and scams.

A LAN physically links several PCs to each other and often to a server that hosts shared data or provides access to the Internet. This is accomplished with a variety of materials—twisted-wire cables, fiber optics, copper phone lines, and even infrared light and radio signals.&lt;/p&gt;</div><div>&lt;p&gt;Whatever the technology, the goal is the same—to send data from one place to another. Usually, the data is in the form of a message from one computer to another. The message might be a query for data, the reply to another PC’s data request, an instruction to run a program that’s stored on the network, or a message to be forwarded to the Internet.&lt;/p&gt;</div><div><span style=\"line-height: 1.4;\">&lt;p&gt;If the data or program for which the message asks isn’t on the Internet, it might be stored on a PC used by a coworker on the network, or on a &lt;span class=\"bold\"&gt;file server&lt;/span&gt;, which is a specialized computer with multiple large hard drives that are not used exclusively by any individual on the network. Instead, it exists only to serve all the other PCs using the network—called &lt;span class=\"bold\"&gt;clients&lt;/span&gt;—by providing a common place to store data that can be retrieved as rapidly as possible by the clients. Similarly, a network might include an Internet server that links the LAN to the World Wide Web, or &lt;span class=\"bold\"&gt;print servers&lt;/span&gt; that everyone on the LAN can use for printing.&lt;/p&gt;</span></div><div>&lt;p&gt;If a network does not have a dedicated server, it is a &lt;span class=\"bold\"&gt;peer-to-peer network&lt;/span&gt;. In a peer-to-peer network, each individual’s PC (or device) acts as a server to other devices—its peers—on the network and also is a client to all its peers acting as servers. This is the kind of network you probably have at home, and it includes everything from that desktop PC in your office, to your laptop, tablet, smartphone, DVR, and Wi-Fi thermostat.&lt;/p&gt;</div><div>&lt;p&gt;The network must receive requests for access to it from individual computers, or &lt;span class=\"bold\"&gt;nodes&lt;/span&gt;, linked to the network, and the network must have a way of handling simultaneous requests for its services. When a computer has the services of the network, the network needs a way of sending a message from one node to another so that only the node for which it’s intended recognizes it, and it doesn’t pop up on some other unsuspecting PC or device. And the network must do all this as quickly as possible while spreading its services as evenly as possible among all the nodes on the LAN. LANs are a microcosm of the Internet, even as the LANs are a part of the Internet.&lt;/p&gt;</div><div>&lt;p&gt;This chapter looks at the most common types of networks.&lt;/p&gt;</div><div>&lt;/section&gt;</div>","type":"text",".priority":1}},"chapter":"17","number":"0","part":"5","title":"How Networks Tie Computers Together"},"17_1":{"cells":{"1":{"id":1,"image":"","text":"To become part of a network, a computer or device uses a <span class=\"glossary\">network interface</span> to communicate with the local network’s <span class=\"glossary\">backbone</span>, the part of the network that carries the most traffic.

No matter that virtually any book, movie, or song can be found, somewhere, on the Net. And it doesn’t mean a thing that every one of your friends, from the first person you met in kindergarten on up, can be reached through the Internet.&lt;/p&gt;</div><div>&lt;p&gt;Everything about your Internet experience derives from how you get all that data down that last mile to your computer. And not all last miles are the same. The technologies of DSL and cable, the two most common Internet connections, tout themselves sending data at various maximum speeds. Whatever those speeds are, they are the dreams of the engineers and marketers. It’s like me saying I can run four miles a minute—and I can, but only for about 10 feet. The reason I don’t live up to my specs is that I’ve been out of shape since the sixth grade. Internet providers have their own reasons why real broadband doesn’t match advertised broadband.&lt;/p&gt;</div><div>&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=\"bold\"&gt;REASON 1: Latency.&lt;/span&gt; Latency is idling time. Your car may be able to go 200 mph on a straightaway, but that doesn’t mean you’ll drive the 200 miles from Houston to San Antonio in an hour. You’ll have to sit still, engine idling, at stop signs, yields, train crossings, red lights, and school crossings. At best, legally, you’ll be able to drive 70 mph because of a roadway latency called a speed limit. It you make the trip in less than two hours then somewhere along the way, you broke the law.&lt;/p&gt;</div><div><span>&lt;p&gt;The Internet has its own set of laws, the most fundamental of which is the speed of light. Nothing moves faster than that, although satellite Internet transmissions come close—until they transfer to earthbound channels. Light in empty space requires roughly 5 ms to travel 1,000 miles. Most ground long-distance Internet traffic also uses light in fiber optic cable, but it doesn’t move as quickly as in outer space. Refraction—the bending of light waves—lengthens the time it takes data to travel 1,000 miles in fiber optic to 7.5ms.

Not only are we creating more printouts than ever before, but computer printing has gained a third-dimension, with printers that can print functional three-dimensional objects. These &lt;span class=\"bold\"&gt;3D Printers&lt;/span&gt; may now be the domain of high-end labs and enthusiasts with cash to burn, but the day is coming when you’ll find one in every home, just like the inkjets and laser printers of today. And they’ll change everything.&lt;/p&gt;</span></div><div>&lt;p&gt;Whoever made that erroneous prediction about the end of printing missed an important fact. That person was probably thinking about how offices used paper in the age of the typewriter. Back then there wasn’t much you could put on paper except black letters and numbers—most often in an efficient but drab typeface called Courier. If all those ugly memos and letters had been replaced by electronic mail, the world would not have suffered a great loss. But what forecasters didn’t see is that software and printing technology would make possible fast, easy, graphic, and colorful hard copies of reports, newsletters, graphs, and, yes, company budgets and greeting cards, that even IBM’s best Selectric could never come close to producing.&lt;/p&gt;</div><div>&lt;p&gt;Speed and ease were the first improvements in printing. Whereas a simple typo on a typewriter might just be whited out or hand-corrected with a pen, today—because of the speed of printers—it’s easier just to correct a mistake onscreen and print a fresh, flawless copy. Graphics were the next big advance. The day of the all-text document ended with the first software that could print even the crudest line graph on a dot-matrix printer. Now anything that’s visual, from line art to a halftone photograph, can be printed on a standard office printer.&lt;/p&gt;</div><div>&lt;p&gt;That scenario has its evil twin. We often are so trusting of our computers ability to automatically remedy the mistakes in our lives, that a fresh, flawed copy comes out of the printer with such speed and cleanliness that it looks perfect. It’s almost unthinkable that in this beautiful, double-justified text in sleek Helvetica with a thin line between the main body of text and a perfectly-centered page number, there lurks an uncaught typo of the word “shiite.”&lt;/p&gt;</div><div>&lt;p&gt;The computer printer has opened the door to vast world of typefaces and typographical effects. Once the only way to give words emphasis was to underline them. Today, we can make words bold, italic, double-underlined, narrow-faced, heavy black faced, small caps, reversed, outlined, and dropcapped. Not only are we capable, sometimes we actually use them<span>—</span><span>all of them</span><span>—</span><span>in the same document. How can we help it? Laborious typing has turned into fun-filled laser printing.&lt;/p&gt;</span></div><div><span>&lt;p&gt;There are literally thousands of free typefaces today, where a 100 years ago there were but dozens at best, and most commercial printers had only a few of the costly molds for for those fonts in hot type. Now at no extra cost, we can give our documents comic book text, blood-dripping letters from posters for Resident Evil XIII, or type that tries to portray you as a person of such elegance that your business cards are printed with a beautiful but illegible script.&lt;/p&gt;</span></div><div><span>&lt;p&gt;Soon it was color, which began as an expensive luxury, but as the quality and speed of color printers increased, so too did the cost decrease. A $100 printer can copy a document, scan a photo for you to retouch, and then spit out the fixed version photo on high-quality photo paper, suitable for framing.&lt;/p&gt;</span></div><div><span>&lt;p&gt;Paper hasn’t disappeared from the office. Instead, it’s taken on a whole new importance. And the lowly printer that used to turn out crude approximations of characters is now one of the most important components of a computer system.

Made from an alloy of lead, tin, and antimony, each letter was molded on one end to create a mirror image of the character to be printed. They were placed, molded side out, on a tray, one after the other, until an entire line of mirrored words was created. And then the type setter started on the next line. When a page’s worth of type was done, the type was bound into a form, coated with ink, and a press forced parchment or paper against the type to pick up the ink.&lt;/p&gt;</div><div>&lt;figure class=\"right\"&gt;</div><div><div><span>&lt;img src=\"</span>s3/images/22_0/2200_fig02.png<span>\"</span><span>/&gt;</span></div></div><div><span>&lt;figcaption&gt;Movable type loaded into a case to take on a life as printing.&lt;/figcaption&gt;</span></div><div><span>&lt;/figure&gt;</span></div><div>&lt;p&gt;It may sound like a slow way to print the Bible, but it was an amazing revolution in the spread of ideas and information throughout Europe. The other amazing thing about Gutenberg’s press is that it took 500 years for someone to come up with something better. As late as the 19th century, Mark Twain sank all the money he earned making people laugh into various machines to automate the assembly of type into rows of text. Or that’s what they were supposed to do if they worked.&lt;/p&gt;</div><div>&lt;p&gt;Why did it take 500 years to come up with something better? Because Gutenberg’s press was the evolutionary equivalent of the first fish that sprouted legs and decided to explore dry land on foot. Soon after that, for millions of years, feet were dominant. Every self-respecting creature had at least two. It was only when wings came along that animals had a different way to get places. Even then, walking still hasn’t gone out of style for millennia.&lt;/p&gt;</div><div>&lt;p&gt;You have to have fundamental evolutionary breakthroughs before you see inventions such as laser, inkjet, and 3D printers. The car isn’t a breakthrough invention; it’s a gradual evolution from the horse-drawn wagon. The interstate highways are currently the highest state of evolution in roadways, but there’s been no fundamental breakthrough in them since the earliest footpaths.&lt;/p&gt;</div><div>&lt;p&gt;Computing is a fundamental, evolutionary breakthrough. The first computer and the first transistor are not important because of what they were able to do at the time of their creation. They are important because they opened up a world of other inventions: streaming video and audio; topological weather forecasts; “big data” that allows us to look at people, nature, and society in a depth we’ve not had before. No one came up with a better way of printing for 500 years because technology builds for centuries on one tiny improvement after another until, suddenly, there’s something no one had imagined. No one created computing with the idea that it would design space ships, teach us languages, track our money, or even calculate how long we will live. If someone in, oh, 1944 had said, “I’m going to create something that will enable us to send pictures from here to China in a matter of seconds, and while it’s at it, translate a letter from English to Chinese,” that person would have been called crazy. (And he would have been.) There was nothing in 1944 to suggest to any sane person that all the things we take for granted today would ever be possible.&lt;/p&gt;</div><div>&lt;p&gt;The point of this is that we’re all in the same situation Gutenberg was. We’re just now seeing powerful, enabling technology emerge and swiftly change how we live as individuals and function as societies. Can you imagine what will be available 500 years from now? No, you can’t. In the next 500 years several fundamental evolutionary breakthroughs will surely occur. But we have no more specific idea of what they may be than Gutenberg had of printers that created text with light, printers that created body parts from something called plastic, or all the other previously unimaginable printers in this chapter.&lt;/p&gt;</div><div>&lt;p&gt;What we can hope is that the coming evolutionary breakthrough is something that, like the computer, has far-ranging effects—effects that, after thousands of years, will enable us to have decent societies built on all the principles that we know, even now, they should be. Peace. Justice. Health. Prosperity. We know the world should have those in abundance. We just don’t have the thing—that little piece of movable technology—that will lead to making our best and noblest ideas into physical reality.&lt;/p&gt;<div>&lt;/section&gt;</div></div>","type":"step",".priority":1}},"chapter":"22","number":"0","part":"6","title":"Printing Gutenberg Never Imagined"},"22_1":{"cells":{"1":{"id":1,"image":"s3/images/22_1/prism.png","number":"1","text":"All color is made up of different combinations of light.

MIT’s Marvin Minsky said, “Within a generation… the problem of creating ‘artificial intelligence’ will substantially be solved.” And movie theaters were showing The Graduate, starring a young Dustin Hoffman as a recent college graduate who hadn’t found his place in the world. At a party of his parents’ friends, one of them pulled Hoffman aside to give him a clue for success in one word: “Plastics.”&lt;/p&gt;</div><div><span></span></div><div>&lt;p&gt;<span>&lt;figure class=\"left\"&gt;</span></div><div><div>&lt;img src=\"s3/images/23_-1/part07fig01.png\"/&gt;</div><div><span>&lt;figcaption&gt;“I just want to say one word to you.

Now, 47 years later, what word would wily wonks whisper to those getting started? I have a few ideas, and I’ll whisper them to you in a second. But you should know they are based on extrapolating the past evolution in computing into computing’s future. And, of course, the future is rarely predictable. The one truth I’ve always found in predictions is that what finally comes to pass is almost always something no one ever predicted. Expensive, fancy coffee shops on every corner? Brand-new designer jeans sold with holes in the knees? Pomegranate martinis?&lt;/p&gt;</div><div>&lt;p&gt;Who knew?&lt;/p&gt;</div><div><span>&lt;p&gt;</span>So, now that I’ve given the necessary warning that fate does what it darn well pleases, here are my words for success, starting with…&lt;/p&gt;</div><div>&lt;h1&gt;QUANTUM&lt;/h1&gt;</div><div>&lt;p&gt;You’ve surely heard of quantum physics, but you don’t understand it. No one does. That’s what makes it such a hot prospect for the future—that and the fact that its natural stomping grounds are the fundamental building blocks of matter and time. Talk about getting in on the ground floor!&lt;/p&gt;</div><div><span>&lt;p&gt;</span>One other aspect of quantum physics that suggests endless possibilities is that even if we don’t really understand how quantum physics works, that doesn’t stop us from using it in computers and other technology. One of the not understood quantum fundamentals is that on the atomic level you can’t be sure of anything. It’s so fundamental that there’s a name for it: the &lt;span class=\"bold\"&gt;uncertainty principle&lt;/span&gt;. It goes something like this: It’s impossible to say where an atom’s electron is and how fast it’s moving at the same time. The act of observing the electron can only be done by bouncing some force off it, usually electromagnetic waves, and seeing what results you get. But when you bounce something off a particle in quantum-land, you’re nudging it one way or the other so that it’s no longer in the same place or traveling at the same speed.&lt;/p&gt;</div><div><span>&lt;figure class=\"right\"&gt;</span></div><div><span>&lt;img src=\"s3/images/23_-1/part07fig02.png\"/&gt;</span><br></div><div>&lt;figcaption&gt;Even a peek inside D-Wave's quantum computer provides little due as to how it works.&lt;/figcaption&gt;</div><div>&lt;/figure&gt;</div><div><span>&lt;p&gt;</span>Quantum math says it could be anywhere—from gallivanting around a nucleus, as it’s supposed to do, to being imbedded deep within Saturn’s moon Titan. The best we can do is calculate the &lt;span class=\"bold\"&gt;probability&lt;/span&gt; of an electron being somewhere. (I’d guess Titan’s probability is on the low end, but I’m not a mathematician.) Microchips use the electron’s wayward ways to store data. Changing the charge in a transistor raises the probability that some electrons will wind up on the other side of a wall that the odds say they could not ordinarily pass through. No one says how they get there, but it’s probable enough that they do get there. When the charge is removed, the probability that they’ll pass back through the wall—back to where they started—nosedives. They’re trapped even if power is turned off, giving us flash memory.&lt;/p&gt;</div><div><span>&lt;p&gt;</span>Another quantum property that could find its way into computers is &lt;span class=\"bold\"&gt;entanglement&lt;/span&gt;, or as Einstein called it, “spooky action at a distance.” Despite Einstein’s skepticism, scientists have verified that when two electrons become entangled—just how that happens varies—they instantaneously affect the state of each other even if they are separated by light years. If one electron is spinning clockwise and the other counterclockwise, changing the rotation of the first electron to counterclockwise results in the second electron reversing itself to spin clockwise.&lt;/p&gt;</div><div><span>&lt;p&gt;</span>The immediate application of this spookiness is that it eliminates the time used by electricity or light to send information from one point to another. Spooky communications has already been demonstrated in a PC. Entanglement is in the same stage that radio waves were when they were first discovered; it took a while for radio waves to evolve into TV, satellite transmissions, mobile phones, radar, and garage door openers. Get to work, young graduate, on entanglement, before everything gets sorted out by someone else. Entanglement plays a role in the holy grail of quantum: the &lt;span class=\"bold\"&gt;quantum computer&lt;/span&gt;. Quantum computers do not use ordinary bits that have one of two values, 1 or 0. Instead they have &lt;span class=\"bold\"&gt;qubits&lt;/span&gt;, which can represent a 1, a 0, or a superposition of 1 and 0 so that the qubit can simultaneously represent 1, 0, and all the values in between. As the number of qubits in a computer increases, the number of superimposed values rises exponentially. This gives them the computing muscle to instantly create unbreakable codes and to solve complex problems. But a problem with qubits is finding out what their values are. Directly observing qubits effectively turns them into bits, and their wealth of potential data is lost.&lt;/p&gt;</div><div><span>&lt;p&gt;</span>Researchers see entanglement as the tool to read quantum states. By entangling qubits so that one reflects the state of another, it’s possible to observe the state of a remote qubit to learn the value in a qubit back in the computer, without destroying the qubit’s special state. If, after reading that, you could use some ibuprofen, you’re not alone.&lt;/p&gt;</div><div><span>&lt;p&gt;</span>As I’m writing this, there’s no word on whether this scenario for quantum computing will work. But a company named D-Wave Systems plans to have an operational quantum computer by 2015. There’s a lot of skepticism about that plan because no one outside DWave has been able to spend the time with the computer needed to test it. At the same time, no one doubts that someone at some time will come up with a quantum machine that works.&lt;/p&gt;</div><div><span>&lt;h1&gt;</span>QUANTUM DOTS&lt;/h1&gt;</div><div><span>&lt;img class=\"right\" src=\"s3/images/23_-1/part07fig03.png\"/&gt;</span><br></div><div>&lt;p&gt;So called because they’re small enough that they operate at the quantum physics stage, &lt;span class=\"bold\"&gt;quantum&lt;/span&gt; dots are created by bombarding a semiconductor material, such as silicon or cadmium selenide, with beams of atoms or ions that pound 100 to 1,000 atoms of the material into a single crystal a few nanometers wide.&lt;/p&gt;</div><div><span>&lt;p&gt;</span>When a laser, or an ultraviolet or blue light—both of which carry more energy than other shades of the spectrum— strikes a quantum dot, the light’s photons energize the dot’s material, which expels the extra energy as a second light. The trick is that the dot doesn’t necessarily emit the color of light that it has been absorbing. The dot’s size determines now much energy it emits, which determines the color. The biggest quantum dots produce the shortest wavelength, creating red light. The smallest dots create shorter wavelengths, producing blue. In-between sizes put out the other colors in the spectrum.&lt;/p&gt;</div><div><span>&lt;p&gt;</span>Even at the early stage in Q-dot development, its achievements and potential come shining through. In video displays, Q-dots increase the size of the color gamut—the range of colors a display can produce—by 40% to 50%. At the same time it uses 15% to 20% less electricity, furthering battery life in smartphones and tablets. Amazon’s Kindle Fire HDX 7 is the first tablet to burn bright with quantum dots, putting to shame Apple’s Retina displays on similarly sized tablets.&lt;/p&gt;</div><div><span>&lt;figure class=\"left\"&gt;</span></div><div><span>&lt;img src=\"s3/images/23_-1/part07fig04.png\"/&gt;</span><br></div><div><span>&lt;figcaption&gt;The monitor on the left is juiced up with quantum dots for a greater gamut.&lt;/figcaption&gt;</span></div><div><span>&lt;/figure&gt;</span></div><div><span>&lt;p&gt;</span>That’s just for starters. Early work with quantum dots suggests they could replace transistors. And in quantum computers, which currently envision dealing with particles smaller than an atom, Q-dots could turn out to be a more manageable medium to work with.&lt;/p&gt;</div><div><span>&lt;p&gt;</span>Expanding beyond the computing realm, quantum dots may one day save your life. Medical imaging has begun to use &lt;span class=\"bold\"&gt;colloidal&lt;/span&gt; (in liquid solution) quantum dots. Because quantum dots can be used in a fluid, they can become dyes. When joined with proteins that target specific cells, such as cancer, they literally light up diseased or malignant tissues. The photo below shows human red blood cells, in which specific membrane proteins are targeted and colorlabeled with quantum dots. In this case, the number of purple features, which indicate the nuclei of malaria parasites, increases as malaria development progresses.&lt;/p&gt;</div><div>&lt;img class=\"center\" src=\"s3/images/23_-1/<span style=\"font-size: 18px; line-height: 1.4;\">part07fig05-h.png\"/&gt;</span></div><div><span>&lt;h1&gt;</span>DEEP LEARNING&lt;/h1&gt;</div><div>&lt;p&gt;A few years ago, a list like this one would have included artificial intelligence. Today AI is becoming the new jet-pack, a clever idea in science fiction, but lacking in science fact. Most attempts at AI have involved writing complex rules for a computer to follow independently in complex situations.&lt;/p&gt;</div><div><span>&lt;p&gt;</span>Why have none of them succeeded? First, think about how your intelligence was developed. You learned speech, how to walk, throw a ball, dance , and laugh at jokes, which are all intellectual skills involving interaction with the external world. But you didn’t learn those skills by anyone else telling you how to do them. (OK, dancing may be the exception, at least if you’re a white male in high school.) Most of the things we know and the skills we use came from assimilation. As infants and toddlers we heard our parents making sounds, so we attempted to do the same with our baby gurglings and sounds like “Ba-ba-ba-ba!” Eventually our brains recognized a pattern. Certain words were used around certain people, objects, and actions. It takes about two years for us to understand the fundamentals of speech, but we do it so naturally because the brain can’t easily communicate with others until it has learned language.&lt;/p&gt;</div><div><span>&lt;figure class=\"left\"&gt;</span></div><div><span>&lt;img src=\"s3/images/23_-1/part07fig06.png\"/&gt;</span><br></div><div><span>&lt;figcaption&gt;This is what Google's deep learner decided were the proper generalized images for a human and a cat face.&lt;/figcaption&gt;</span></div><div>&lt;/figure&gt;</div><div><span>&lt;p&gt;</span>Now some computer scientists are throwing away rule-based programs for a field called &lt;span class=\"bold\"&gt;deep learning&lt;/span&gt;. It lets computers learn on their own. Sort of. The computers do get some guidance and correction. But basically what deep learning uses are large numbers of processors and equally huge amounts of data to feed to those processors. Mention that combination and what leaps to mind is Google, which has plenty of both. And, in fact, Google’s on the forefront of deep learning.&lt;/p&gt;</div><div><span>&lt;p&gt;</span>The fundamental concept is that billions of computer connections can work like the cortex’s billions of neurons. Google set up 16,000 processor cores and for three days showed the system 10 million images from randomly selected YouTube videos. If you’re familiar with Google and its YouTube service, then you know that many of those random images had to be of cats. The researchers did nothing to label cat images or define the concept of a cat, and yet the artificial neurons developed an ability to recognize not only cats but also flowers and human faces and body shapes with little outside prompting. Linking those images to one of 22,000 categories to choose from—some of which required handling such niceties as the difference between two types of skate fish—the network was accurate 15.8% of the time. That may not sound all that impressive, but it was a 70% improvement over the previous state-of-the-art system. And when the 22,000 categories were reduced to 1,000, accuracy was better than 50%. Google has already used the system to improve the speed recognition of Iris—Google’s Betty to Apple’s Veronica—Siri.&lt;/p&gt;</div><div><span>&lt;p&gt;</span>All right. So you still wouldn’t put the system up against a Las Vegas blackjack table. It still has a way to go. But that’s the good news. That means there’s time for you to wiggle into what is still one of the next big things.&lt;/p&gt;</div><div><span>&lt;h1&gt;</span>GRAPHENE&lt;/h1&gt;</div><div>&lt;p&gt;Suppose you took the “lead” out of your pencil. (You know it’s really graphite, a form of carbon, right?) Then you squashed it and rolled it like pizza dough until it was just &lt;span class='italic'&gt;one molecule thick&lt;/span&gt;. You’d have graphene, the product that’s the hottest substance since…well…since plastic.&lt;/p&gt;</div><div><div>&lt;figure class=\"right\"&gt;</div><div><span>&lt;img src=\"s3/images/23_-1/part07fig07.png\"/&gt;</span><br></div><div><span>&lt;figcaption&gt;</span>Graphene is said to be 200 times stronger than steel. Some researcher determined that a sheet the thickness of plastic wrap would support an elephant poised atop a pencil, in turn standing on the sheet. (Image courtesy of Extreme Tech)&lt;/figcaption&gt;</div><div>&lt;/figure&gt;</div></div><div><span>&lt;p&gt;</span>The difference between graphite and graphene—and by the way, don’t try smashing your pencil to make graphene; there are much easier ways—the difference is that when carbon atoms are all bunched together in graphite, their electrons are bouncing around, giving themselves a sort of collective mass. But spread the atoms into a thin sheet, and the electrons behave as if they are massless with particles moving through empty space at near the speed of light. And that makes for a different story.&lt;/p&gt;</div><div><span>&lt;p&gt;</span><span>You have something that looks like a shadow you can pick up and hold. Graphene is 35% better at conducting electricity than copper. Electrons move 1,000 times better than in silicon. It conducts heat better than any other substance. It stretches up to 20% of its length, but it’s stiffer than diamond. It’s totally impermeable; not even helium atoms can squeeze through it.</span>&lt;/p&gt;<br></div><div><span>&lt;p&gt;</span>That all suggests wonderful possibilities, although few of them have, yet, come to fruition despite more than 8,000 patents for its use, mostly in China and the United States. One Polish manufacturer gives samples to anyone who asks, hoping one of them will come up with a marketable use and then buy more graphene. Everyone who looks at graphene agrees that it’s a mind-blowing substance…for something. Sounds like a field perfect for a young graduate.&lt;/p&gt;</div><div><span>&lt;h1&gt;</span>3D PRINTING&lt;/h1&gt;</div><div><span>&lt;img class=\"left\" src=\"s3/images/23_-1/part07fig08.png\"/&gt;</span></div><div>&lt;p&gt;So far most applications for 3D printing have been limited to art, jewelry, and things as far ranging as spare parts for a dish washer to a PEZ dispenser with your own head on it. More impressive uses are on the way in medicine, where 3D printers have been used to fabricate living skin. As 3D printers get bigger, someone’s going to find a way to print a bungalow or a Bentley.&lt;/p&gt;</div><div><span>&lt;p&gt;</span>Look at it this way. When Gutenberg invented his printing press, did he imagine such spin-offs as color printing, daily newspapers, education, engraving, rock concert posters, bumper stickers, or laminated kitchen floors? This is a perfect example of how we started this discussion, with the observation that whatever you predict, the odds are the outcome is going to be something no one’s imagined. If that sounds good to you, check out Amazon’s 3D printer store and get to work.&lt;/p&gt;</div><div><span>&lt;p&gt;</span>A 3-D printer created this ear using a gel made of calf cells.

Why, that’s not big enough to count all the people in Murfreesboro, Tennessee! Luckily processor upgrades gave PCs the ability to work with 32 bits at a time, taking them up to the decimal notation of 4,294,967,295. Not bad, but the processors in common use in 2014 and (spoiler alert!) for a long time into the future can juggle 64 bits with the ease of The Flying Karamazov Brothers throwing swords back and forth—and a lot more easily than the boys juggling 281,474,976,710,655 swords, the decimal equivalent of 64 bits.&lt;/p&gt;</span></div><div>&lt;p&gt;A processor being able to tackle more bits simultaneously doesn’t result only in bigger numbers. Higher bit counts mean more data and instructions can be moved from memory into the processor in a single trip. That means faster computing.&lt;/p&gt;</div><div>&lt;p&gt;It’s a mistake to think of transistors in terms of number alone, however. The same on/off bits can stand for true and false, enabling devices to work with &lt;span class=\"bold\"&gt;Boolean logic&lt;/span&gt;.

If you don’t feel like blowing money on a kid’s toy, pull some change out of your pocket. A dime, penny, nickel, quarter, half-dollar (if you can find one), and a dollar bill have a couple of things in common with the toy rings: None is the same size as any other, and they can be stacked. That's all you need for this passage into the brain-numbing world of the microprocessor.&lt;/p&gt;</div><div>&lt;p&gt;This is called the Towers of Hanoi Puzzle. It’s simple but tedious. All you have to do is move the complete stack of objects—rings, coins, plates, whatever— from their initial position, which I’ll call “A,” to one of two other spots, “B” and “C.” There are two rules:&lt;br/&gt;</div><div>&lt;span class=\"bold\"&gt;1)&lt;/span&gt; You can move only one object at a time&lt;/br&gt;</div><div>&lt;span class=\"bold\"&gt;2)&lt;/span&gt; You cannot place one object on an object smaller than the object you’re moving. For example, you can’t put a quarter on top of a dime.&lt;/p&gt;</div><div>&lt;p&gt;In the original, legendary version of the game, you must move 64 rings while following those rules. It doesn’t sound that complicated. And it’s not, really. Mathematicians have pointed out the similarities between the Towers of Hanoi and binary computations, geometry, and the exact duplication of a function called the binary carry sequence.&lt;/p&gt;</div><div>&lt;p&gt;But never mind all that. Let’s play the game using only three rings, or disks, as we’ve drawn them here:</div><div><span>&lt;img class=\"right\" src=\"</span>s3/images/3_0/0300_fig01.jpg<span>\"/&gt;</span><br></div><div>&lt;ol&gt;</div><div>&nbsp; &nbsp;&lt;li&gt;Take the top, purple disk and place in the empty B spot.<span>&lt;/li&gt;</span></div><div>&nbsp; &nbsp;&lt;li&gt;Place the green disk on C.<span>&lt;/li&gt;</span></div><div>&nbsp; &nbsp;&lt;li&gt;Put the purple disk from position B and put it on top of the green disk.<span>&lt;/li&gt;</span></div><div>&nbsp; &nbsp;&lt;li&gt;Move the yellow disk from A to the B position.<span>&lt;/li&gt;</span></div><div>&nbsp; &nbsp;&lt;li&gt;Put the purple disk on the now empty position A.<span>&lt;/li&gt;</span></div><div>&nbsp; &nbsp;&lt;li&gt;Move the green disk on top of the yellow disk at B.<span>&lt;/li&gt;</span></div><div>&nbsp; &nbsp;&lt;li&gt;Move the purple disk to sit on the green disk.<span>&lt;/li&gt;</span></div><div>&lt;/ol&gt;</div><div>&lt;p&gt;There. In seven moves you’ve relocated three rings to a different spot. As you may have guessed, it gets more intricate as you move down through the stack—not more difficult, just more, and more, of the same. Add one more disk, and it takes 15 moves. Ten disks add 1,023 moves.&lt;/p&gt;</div><div>&lt;p&gt;The Towers of Hanoi Puzzle was discovered by French mathematician Edouard Lucas in 1883. A legend, possibly created by Lucas, has it that there is a temple with a room that contains three poles and 64 gold disks with holes in the centers. The priests at the temple are on a mission from God to move all the discs from one pole to another, Towers-of-Hanoi style. When they complete the task, the world will come to an end. Not to worry. The number of moves to complete the puzzle increases exponentially as the number of discs increases. If the priests could move one disc each second, it would take them 2&lt;span class=\"super\"&gt;64&lt;/span&gt;–1 seconds, or roughly 585 billion years, which is 127 times the age of the sun, to complete all the 18,446,744,073,709,551,615 moves required to finish the mission.&lt;/p&gt;</div><div>&lt;p&gt;This sort of mind-numbing task was made for computing. The &lt;span class=\"bold\"&gt;CPU&lt;/span&gt;, or &lt;span class=\"bold\"&gt;central processing unit&lt;/span&gt;, whether in a computer, a watch, a smartphone, or even a toaster oven plays its own version of the Towers of Hanoi. Like the moves in the puzzle, the methods used by processors work by doing the same thing many times. Multiplying 100 by 3,000 is accomplished by adding 3,000 a hundred times. Division consists of subtracting one number from another continuously until the result is 0 or the final number is not large enough to subtract the divisor from it.&lt;/p&gt;</div><div>&lt;p&gt;In the most powerful processors for PCs, the CPU can work with 64 bits at a time, but this doesn’t mean that in the monks’ full 65 ring game, a 64-bit computer could grab the first 64 disks and move them all at once. It still has to move only one tower ring with each tick of its internal clock, but the computer could simultaneously move one ring on 63 other towers. (A processor such as the Intel Core i7-965 Extreme Edition, with a clock speed of 3.20 gigahertz—3,200,000,000 ticks of the clock every second—could complete the monks’ original tower exercise in 13 day and four hours.)&lt;/p&gt;</div><div>&lt;p&gt;A processor is limited in the number of places it can put the binary numbers representing the bits while still carrying out its software’s instructions. After adding two numbers, the CPU might need to put the result in a part of the chip that acts as a temporary holding pen. After adding two more numbers, it retrieves the stored number to add it to the sum of the second addition. It’s kind of like how we humans scribble the result of some math operation on a slip of paper, so we can use it a minute later when we solve a related problem.&lt;/p&gt;</div><div>&lt;p&gt;Much is made of all the amazing things computing can do, but what it can’t do, so far, requires intuition, the ability to find a link among seemingly dissimilar ideas. When, in 1997, IBM’s Big Blue computer was the first machine to win a tournament with a reigning chess champion—Garry Kasparov—it did so by playing “what if.” What if it moved this piece, and then Kasparov moved that piece, and so on through six to eight moves starting from 20 or more contingencies. Big Blue was capable of 200 million positions a second. It’s much like doing the Towers of Hanoi—very fast. Human chess champions, on the other hand, say they uniformly avoid the what-if approach in favor of patterns. They will look at the board, and the years of experience buried in their brains see patterns of pieces that reveal a strategy to a win. Or, in Kasparov’s case, a loss.&lt;/p&gt;</div><div>&lt;p&gt;Humans are very good at insight and hunches. Computing is very good at doing the same thing over and over again. Remember that when your computer seems to be taking too long to do something. It's just plodding along in its own manner.

And software really is magical. You invoke your computer—maybe with a touch, at the command of your voice, with the wink of an eye, or by pointing at a little picture with a mouse and clicking—and suddenly all these things begin to happen that could only be witchery. Beautiful color images and voices and sounds emanate from your PC. The software looks at a few numbers and predicts banana futures in three months. Ask your smartphone for information on a person, a country, or a date, and the phone responds like a crystal ball. You ask the software in a tablet to take you high in the clouds over someone’s home on the other side of the world, and you’re there in seconds—<i>seconds</i>! Magic carpets just can’t compete.&lt;/p&gt;<div>&lt;p&gt;Software’s abracadabra needn’t be a mystery to those of us who don’t speak VB, Java, C, C++, C#, PHP, and other curiously named software languages. It’s its own form of poetry. Within the words are hidden meanings, plots and subplots, forms more rigid than an iambic pentameter. And like a lot of ordinary poetry, it’s difficult for the layman to understand it all. We have to turn to the experts—the machines that read software.&lt;/p&gt;</div><div>&lt;p&gt;You’ve done just that. Before you bought your desktop PC, your iPad, or your Galaxy 5S, you had used software. Software doesn’t include only things like Word, Photoshop, and Angry Birds. Software is also music recordings and Blu-ray discs. Blueprints for building a dog house, a dress pattern, and a telephone number are &lt;span class=\"bold\"&gt;programs&lt;/span&gt;. A program is simply any set of instructions for an ordered series of actions. A program can exist as a printout of computer code or as a recipe in a cookbook. And you’re already a programmer, even if you’ve never touched a computer.&lt;/p&gt;</div><div>&lt;p&gt;Have you created a playlist of the best of Green Day? Have you set your DVR to record every episode of &lt;span class=\"italic\"&gt;The Daily Show&lt;/span&gt;, excepting the reruns? Have you entered the phone numbers of your contacts into your phone? Each time, you were programming. A program is simply a recipe, whether for Aunt Hattie’s chocolate pie or for how to calculate the paychecks for a thousand employees.&lt;/p&gt;</div><div>&lt;p&gt;There are, inevitably, layers of nuance. Think of what you do when you use a microwave. You press buttons in a certain order to make the microwave work at a specific power level for a certain length of time, then change to a different power level, and so on until your program produces a steaming hot beef stew. That’s programming—a set of instructions in a particular order—created on the fly. But if you press a button that’s preset for microwave popcorn, you’re using software—a preconfigured set of programming instructions that, in this case, are recorded permanently in a microchip inside the microwave.&lt;/p&gt;</div><div>&lt;p&gt;Hardware is capable of doing a variety of tasks, but without programming and software to control it, hardware can’t do much of anything. By itself, for example, a claw hammer is useful only as a paperweight, but used by a carpenter, it can drive nails, pull out old nails, and even crack walnuts. The carpenter swinging the hammer is programming it on the fly. A home entertainment center is a complex system of hardware capable of generating a variety of sights and sounds, but it can’t whisper a peep on its own. It needs software in the form of a disc, or a Roku video streamer, or at least a basic cable connection. The signals from the disc, the network connection, and cable tell the hardware what electrical pulses to use to re-create the sounds of Mahler’s Tenth Symphony or the sights of &lt;span class=\"italic\"&gt;The Avengers&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</div><div>&lt;h1&gt;Software of the Second Millennium&lt;/h1&gt;</div><div>&lt;figure class=\"right\"&gt;</div><div><span>&lt;img src=\"</span><span>s3/images/5_-1/part02fig01.png\"</span><span>/&gt;</span></div><div><span>&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;h1&gt;</span>The Jacquard Loom&lt;/h1&gt;In 1804, Joseph-Marie Jacquard programmed a weaving loom using a series of punched cards to form patterns in the fabric. Punch cards to enter data and instructions into computers were used well into the 20th century.&lt;/figcaption&gt;</div><div>&lt;/figure&gt;</div><div>&lt;p&gt;If you think of software as a recorded set of instructions that control the actions of a machine, then software’s really been around for quite some time. Music notation is written instructions for programming a piano on the fly. But if you have a player piano, the rolls of punched paper are its software. In the 18th century, weaving was done by someone manually slipping a bobbin wrapped with thread over and under other threads on a loom. The process was slow and rife with opportunities for slip-ups. But in 1804, Joseph-Marie Jacquard programmed a weaving loom using a series of &lt;span class=\"bold\"&gt;punched cards&lt;/span&gt; that controlled what patterns were woven into a fabric. Different cards resulted in different patterns. Jacquard’s invention is considered the birth of modern computer programming, and punch cards were used with computers well into the 20th century. The invention was also the occasion for the first wave of being scared by technology. In 1811, Ned Ludd, a Nottingham weaver who feared the new looms would replace people, led his co-workers in a frenzied attack on the machinery. &lt;span class=\"bold\"&gt;Luddite&lt;/span&gt; has come to mean any person who resists technology advancements.&lt;/p&gt;</div><div>&lt;p&gt;Software made little progress for the next century. In 1889, Thomas A. Edison invented the kinetoscope, a hardware device that let people view moving pictures on film. Film, sound recordings, and radio broadcasts—things we don’t normally think of as software—are, in fact, just that, and the most prevalent form of software in the first half of the 20th century.&lt;/p&gt;</div><div>&lt;p&gt;The first computers had neither a keyboard nor a monitor, and they had no software. Their creators programmed instructions by tediously flipping a series of switches in a precise arrangement. This set up a pattern of on and off electrical currents, and the computer in turn activated more electrical switches in the form of vacuum tubes. Finally, the result was displayed in the form of a panel of lights turned off or on to represent the zeroes and ones in the binary number system.&lt;/p&gt;</div><div>&lt;p&gt;John von Neumann in 1945 first proposed the idea of a general-purpose electronic &lt;span class=\"bold\"&gt;digital computer&lt;/span&gt; with a stored program. But the computer, the ENIAC, was not built until 1952. Meanwhile, scientists in England in 1948 created the Manchester Mark I, the first computer that could store a program electronically instead of making programmers set switches manually.&lt;/p&gt;</div><div>&lt;p&gt;During the next two decades, computers gained such accouterments as keyboards and displays. They used software in the form of punched cards, punched paper tape, and magnetic tape. All those forms of software were awkward and slow to use compared to modern software, but they made life much easier for early programmers.&lt;/p&gt;</div><div>&lt;p&gt;Not that there were many programmers back then to have easier lives. Some of the earliest writers of software sprang from a model railroad club at MIT. The railroaders used telephone switches to control their complex system of tracks, crossings, and rail switches. In the railroad, they had created a simple and very specialized form of computer. They already thought in terms of switches, the perfect training for writing software.&lt;/p&gt;</div><div>&lt;p&gt;Most of the software writing then was going on in the universities, military, and businesses that were big enough to afford the then room-filling computers, called &lt;span class=\"bold\"&gt;mainframes&lt;/span&gt;. But regardless of where different programs originated, in the 1960s they had one thing in common: They would work only on a specific computer for a specialized purpose. A program that was written, for example, to handle Gizmo Corp.’s payroll was customized specifically to match that company’s accounting practices and record keeping, and it would run only on a computer configured like the one at Gizmo Corp. If another company wanted a payroll program, it was written from the ground up again. And if a manager at Gizmo wanted to look at payroll information from a different angle, the entire program had to be altered.&lt;/p&gt;</div><div>&lt;figure class=\"left\"&gt;</div><div><span>&lt;img src=\"</span><span>s3/images/5_-1/part02fig02.png\"</span><span>/&gt;</span><br></div><div><span>&lt;figcaption&gt;</span>Although a computer bug has come to be associated with faulty software, the bug from which the term derives its name was found in a computer’s mechanical relay, causing it to malfunction. It was taped into a logbook by Dr. Grace Hopper.&lt;/figcaption&gt;</div><div>&lt;/figure&gt;</div><div>&lt;p&gt;Programs back then had one other thing in common: They were either very expensive or free. Computer companies, such as IBM, saw software as a tool to sell hardware—”&lt;span class=\"bold\"&gt;big iron&lt;/span&gt;.” Because each program was a custom job—in a discipline that was still finding itself—companies expected to spend thousands of dollars. And compared to a computer that cost millions, a few thousand for software didn’t seem so bad.&lt;/p&gt;</div><div>&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, computer companies didn’t charge for an operating system—the crucial software that lets a computer run a program that performs specific applications. Think of an operating system as the producer of a movie. The producer doesn’t appear on screen. But that person works behind the scenes, hiring writers, directors and actors, finding and paying the hundreds of people responsible for building sets, lighting the scenes, driving stars to locations, and serving lunch—all so that the actors can do their best without having to worry about the hundreds of details that are essential to creating a blockbuster—or a flop.&lt;/p&gt;</div><div>&lt;p&gt;Early on, programmers routinely swapped their software code with other programmers. Many saw computers as more than business tools. Computers, somehow, were going to be the great equalizer. Information was going to be the next industrial revolution, and computers were going to give Joe Blow access to the same information available to the board of GM. Such idealism, joined with the fact that all programmers were really just in the learning stage, led to a philosophy that all software should be distributed for free. That ideal is still alive today in the open source movement, where powerful operating systems such as Linux are free and users are encouraged to make improvements for all to share.&lt;/p&gt;</div><div>&lt;p&gt;Gradually, the nature of software changed. Computer companies began unbundling software from hardware. A new working class—the “cowboy,” programmer for hire— traveled from company to company customizing programs and then moving on. In the mid-’60s, it occurred to some of these cowboys that they could write one program and sell it to several companies. A new industry was born.&lt;/p&gt;</div><div>&lt;h1&gt;Killer Software&lt;/h1&gt;</div><div>&lt;figure class=\"right\"&gt;</div><div><span>&lt;img src=\"</span><span>s3/images/5_-1/part02fig03.png\"</span><span>/&gt;</span><br></div><div><span>&lt;figcaption&gt;</span>The first computer program, written in 1948 by Tom Kilburn for the Mark 1, was designed to find the highest proper factor of any number. The necessary divisions were done not by long division but by repeated subtractions. It took 52 minutes to solve the problem for the number 218.&lt;/figcaption&gt;</div><div>&lt;/figure&gt;</div><div>&lt;p&gt;When the personal computer came along, software followed a similar route. The users of the first personal computers—the Altair and the Commodore Pet—were pioneers who expected to do their own programming. They happily shared the coding tricks they learned and the programs they created. A revolution was in the making, although few realized it at the time. All the revolution needed as a spark was the “killer app.”&lt;/p&gt;</div><div>&lt;p&gt;A &lt;span class=\"bold\"&gt;killer app&lt;/span&gt; is an application program so useful and popular that it can create a demand for hardware. The first killer application for the personal computer was VisiCalc. An MIT graduate, Dan Bricklen, made one of those connections that change society. He saw that millions of accountants, business managers, executives, bankers, and stock brokers were wasting their time doing something a computer can do easier and faster: number crunching. Using mechanical adding machines, people were feeding in enormous strings of numbers and crunching them into other numbers. The possibilities for error were great. And the certainty of monotonous labor was greater.&lt;/p&gt;</div><div>&lt;p&gt;The result of Bricklen’s inspiration is the electronic spreadsheet, a killer application by definition because it was easily understood—at least by people who work with numbers—and in the time saved, it quickly paid for itself and a computer to run it on. On the monitor of the first truly mass-market computer, an Apple II, VisiCalc looked substantially like a paper ledger sheet. The hapless accountant still had to enter the numbers to be crunched by the computer, but he didn’t have to add, subtract, divide, multiply them or do it a second time to check his work. VisiCalc did that according to &lt;span class=\"bold; italic\"&gt;formulas&lt;/span&gt;—another type of program—which the computer user types into “cells,” those little rectangles created by the grid of a ledger’s lines. The formulas, of course, were created by humans, and there was always the possibility of human error. But after you got the formula right, you didn’t have to think about it again, and you didn’t have to worry about math mistakes. Just as importantly, you had to enter each relevant number only once. If a five percent sales tax was added to each purchase, the spreadsheet user had only to enter it once for VisiCalc to add the correct sales tax for each purchase.&lt;/p&gt;</div><div>&lt;p&gt;But it wasn’t only accuracy, speed, and ease that made VisiCalc so popular. It was also a matter of power, something business people understood even if they had only the vaguest idea of how these new electronic spreadsheets worked. Until VisiCalc, when a business manager wanted information about customers, sales, inventory, or budget, the manager had to send a request to the IS department, which would get around in the next few days to loading a program and data from huge spools of magnetic tape, letting it all churn for a while and then spitting out the information in the form of cards with holes in them or long streams of green-and-white striped paper. Wars have been fought in less time than it took most managers to get a budget projection.&lt;/p&gt;</div><div><span>&lt;figure class=\"left\"&gt;</span></div><div><span>&lt;img src=\"</span><span>s3/images/5_-1/part02fig03b.png\"</span><span>/&gt;</span><br></div><div><span>&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;h1&gt;</span>Lotus 1-2-3&lt;/h1&gt;Lotus 1-2-3 was the first big business hit on the IBM PC because it combined the functions of an electronic spreadsheet, a database, and graphing. Courtesy of Lotus Corp.&lt;/figcaption&gt;</div><div>&lt;/figure&gt;</div><div>&lt;p&gt;The personal computer changed all that. Within a few minutes, any business person with a passable knowledge of algebra and some fortitude could crunch his own numbers. Knowledge was literally at his fingertips. And in modern commerce, knowledge was valuable. It was power. That power has increased exponentially as people find new and more varied ways to parse huge volumes of data. Facebook, for example, is built on that power.&lt;/p&gt;</div><div>&lt;p&gt;There was another lesson in VisiCalc. The software market was to become something so volatile, so innovative, and so important that no application remained top killer for long. When the IBM PC debuted in 1981, it could not run the software then available for the Apple. Bricklen’s company was slow in creating a version that would run on a PC. Before anyone knew it, the software scene was dominated by a new killer app—one that would run on a PC. The program was Lotus 1-2-3. Introduced in 1982, Lotus was, like VisiCalc, an electronic spreadsheet. But it expanded the definition of spreadsheets by adding capabilities for graphing the data in the spreadsheet and manipulating its information the way a database manager does. The use of graphics was particularly impressive for the IBM PC, which was designed basically to display only text. Lotus 1-2-3 justified the buying of IBM PCs and compatibles in many offices. It also revealed the perils at that time of buying IBM clones. 1-2-3 took advantage of some quirks in the IBM PC to speed up performance. But the same quirks weren’t duplicated in imitation IBM PCs, with the result that 1-2-3 wouldn’t work on some systems. Computer builders were forced to reproduce what they considered flaws in the IBM machine to be sure they could run any software the IBM PC could run.&lt;/p&gt;</div><div>&lt;p&gt;The 1980s were a decade of explosive growth—and often rapid death—of computer makers and software publishers. Software with eccentric names such as Electric Pencil and Volkswriter, both word processors, quickly expanded the capabilities of PCs. The early success of dBASE II, a database manager, inspired countless other programs with “base” in their names . Inevitably, someone created 4-5-6, which added more features to 1-2-3. Many programs filled in functions PCs were lacking. Peter Norton launched a series of products with Norton Unerase, capitalizing on the fact that the PC’s operating system neglected to provide a way to retrieve a file that had been deleted accidentally.&lt;/p&gt;</div><div>&lt;figure class=\"right\"&gt;</div><div><span>&lt;img src=\"</span><span>s3/images/5_-1/part02fig04.png\"</span><span>/&gt;</span><br></div><div><span>&lt;figcaption&gt;</span>The first word processing program to make it to stardom was WordStar, a DOS-based text program notorious for shortcut keys, visible codes, hidden tricks, and the fact it could easily be modified.&lt;/figcaption&gt;</div><div>&lt;/figure&gt;</div><div>&lt;p&gt;At the same time commercial software was burgeoning into every possible niche, another software movement grew alongside the programs from big corporations. In 1982, Andrew Fluegleman created PC-Talk, a program allowing computer users to communicate over phone lines. Despite the name, you did not use PC-Talk by talking. Conversations were typed, but you could also transfer entire programs from one computer to another. The decisive feature of PC-Talk, however, was the fact you could get it for free, and it established an important category of software: &lt;span class=\"bold\"&gt;freeware&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</div><div>&lt;p&gt;In the years preceding the Internet, freeware programs were distributed without charge over electronic bulletin boards accessed with a modem and at the meetings of computer clubs called user groups. Often, freeware was totally free. Other &lt;span class=\"bold\"&gt;shareware&lt;/span&gt; gave you a chance to try the program risk free, but if you liked the software and continued to use it, you were expected to send some money to its author. At $5 to $40, the suggested prices were still cheap compared to software sold in boxes at stores. Some programmers humbly suggested users send whatever they thought the program was worth. Not unsurprisingly, a lot of people used the programs without paying. But enough people were honorable enough and enough shareware was good enough that at least a few programmers made respectable livings.&lt;/p&gt;</div><div>&lt;p&gt;The shareware tradition continues today on the World Wide Web, although now programs you download from the Internet are likely to have some features disabled or stop working after a month to encourage users to pay registration fees. Others, usually on mobile platforms like tablets and smartphones, give you free access to core features but force you to pay small &lt;span class=\"bold\"&gt;microtransactions&lt;/span&gt; to enable extended functions.&lt;/p&gt;</div><div>&lt;p&gt;The abundance of software in the early years also meant confusion. Many programmers had idiosyncratic concepts of what software should do and how it should do it. And they found equally idiosyncratic users. WordStar, for example, quickly dominated the word processor market despite a system for formatting documents based on starting lines with a period—hardly an intuitive approach. But WordStar could be modified by anyone with scant programming knowledge, a bit of daring, and a different idea of how a word processor should work.&lt;/p&gt;</div><div>&lt;h1&gt;Power to the Software&lt;/h1&gt;</div><div>&lt;p&gt;The dominating factor in the early software leaders was not that it came out of the box as an ideal product. Instead, programs like WordStar, 1-2-3, dBASE, and WordPerfect could be manipulated by non-programmers. This was the opposite extreme from the days of big iron, when a bright idea for a way to handle information had to be submitted to the computer pros, who would get around to it Real Soon Now. The factor distinguishing software from all the helpful tools invented before it was that software was malleable. You weren’t limited to using it as intended. One Lotus 1-2-3 user devised a way to use the number cruncher as a word processor. Users of WordPerfect routinely pressed the word processor’s mail merge functions into duty as a database manager.&lt;/p&gt;</div><div>&lt;p&gt;What really accounted for the popularity of the best software was the empowerment it gave people over computers. The best software came with macro or scripting capabilities that gave a layman user enormous control over this new machine. Macros let you record a series of keystrokes or write a list of simple commands for the software to follow. You made the software work the way you thought it should. You could create your own menus, fill in rows of information with a couple of keystrokes, or make your computer connect to a bulletin board service to download the latest games as you slept. There is a physical, Frankensteinian thrill to creating a macro or writing a script in and watching your computer obey your instructions like a faithful genie.&lt;/p&gt;</div><div>&lt;p&gt;There was, of course, despair as well as thrill. The truly insane greatness of the ’80s was as confusing as it was empowering. There was no master plan, no one person in charge of creating software. This often led to brilliant breakthroughs born of an individual spark of genius. But it also led to a new round of learning with each new program. In some programs, you might display a help screen by pressing Alt+H. Or Ctrl+H, or F7, or F1. It was an industry in desperate need of standards. (1-2-3’s F1 came to be accepted by other programs as the standard help key because of 1-2-3’s dominance and the universal need for help.)&lt;/p&gt;</div><div>&lt;p&gt;It wasn’t until Microsoft’s domination of the operating system—first with MS-DOS and then Windows—did some semblance of order contain the wild garden that software was throughout the 20th century.&lt;/p&gt;</div><div>&lt;h1&gt;Operating Systems and Other Software&lt;/h1&gt;</div><div>&lt;p&gt;There are basically two types of software: &lt;span class=\"bold\"&gt;operating systems&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span class=\"bold\"&gt;applications&lt;/span&gt;, regardless of whether your computer is a PC, Mac, iPad, Android tablet, or smartphone (applications are called “apps” in the mobile computing market, but that’s just shorthand.)&lt;/p&gt;</div><div>&lt;p&gt;An operating system is fundamentally different from all other types of software in that an operating system is the one program you must have to do anything with your computer. No computers need a word processing program or a spreadsheet or the game World of Warcraft just to work. But each computer must have an operating system.&lt;/p&gt;</div><div>&lt;p&gt;On its own, a computer can do little more when you turn it on than wake up and, like an infant, search for something to feed it. The food of computers is software, and the appetizer is always the operating system. When a computer boots, it only has enough code built into it to look on a disk or in chip memory for a few crucial operating system files. It pulls those into memory, and they in turn load the rest of the operating system. The loaded operating system establishes rules by which the computer can then load other programs and work with hardware that the computer isn’t smart enough to handle on its own.&lt;/p&gt;</div><div>&lt;figure class=\"right\"&gt;</div><div><span>&lt;img src=\"</span><span>s3/images/5_-1/part02fig05.png\"</span><span>/&gt;</span><br></div><div><span>&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;h1&gt;</span>OS/2&lt;/h1&gt;Operating System 2 (OS/2) began in 1983 as a joint project between Microsoft and IBM for high-end computers. Windows would be the operating system for entry-level PCs. Ten years later, the two companies let the joint development agreement expire. Windows and OS/2 competed for the same market, but OS/2 lost the numbers game. For the first time, a computer company other than IBM carried the standard to which other developers conformed.&lt;/figcaption&gt;</div><div>&lt;/figure&gt;</div><div>&lt;p&gt;The name for Microsoft’s DOS, for example, comes from disk operating system. Originally, DOS was designed as a software tool to create disk files, copy files, delete them, and organize them. All this was done by typing text commands on a black screen. More significantly, DOS let you run other software simply by typing the name of a program. Today Windows, Macs, tablets, and smartphones do the same thing with a click or tap on a tiny cartoon.&lt;/p&gt;</div><div>&lt;p&gt;If you look at the operating system as an office’s mid-level manager then applications are an office’s top executives. Like most executives, the applications have a lot of bright ideas but not the slightest clue about how to carry them out. But applications, like executives, have someone to do the real work. Applications give the OS some general, vague instructions—such as “Save this file with the name mybudget.” The operating system, in turn, passes more detailed instructions on to the office’s clerks, who are the ones who really get their hands dirty. In our little metaphor, the clerks are the computer codes contained in the BIOS, dynamic link libraries, and drivers. These are the people/code who know how the office actually runs—how to record a file or add two numbers.&lt;/p&gt;</div><div>&lt;h1&gt;The Devolution of the OS&lt;/h1&gt;</div><div>&lt;p&gt;If you’ve been using a PC long enough to know what a DOS prompt is, then you know that MS-DOS wasn’t designed to be easy to use. Actually, DOS was only one of two operating systems for the PC. Initially, IBM sold the PC with both Microsoft’s DOS and CP/M-86, an upgrade for the 8086 processor of CP/M (Control Program for Microcomputers). CP/M was a down-and-dirty operating system found on several brands of microcomputers at the time. Both DOS and CPM-86 were more concerned with providing a learning path that would be familiar to people who already knew CP/M, the original computer geeks.&lt;/p&gt;</div><div>&lt;p&gt;Microsoft and other companies realized early on that this shortcoming was a roadblock to more widespread user acceptance, and there were continual attempts on several fronts to improve or replace DOS with an operating system that extends the computer’s capabilities and makes it easier to use. Some operating systems, such as GEOS and DR DOS, gained cult followings but never had the market commitment needed to overtake Microsoft’s own evolving operating system.&lt;/p&gt;</div><div>&lt;p&gt;What an operating system needed more than bells and whistles—what it had to have—was the capability to run the thousands of programs that had already been developed under DOS. Software developers were loath to jump on any bandwagon unless they were sure the public would follow. Microsoft had the only working bandwagon in town. Almost.&lt;/p&gt;</div><div>&lt;p&gt;There was also Apple, which ran on its own proprietary operating system and had a strong, loyal market of students, graphic designers, and iconoclasts. And it had all the pretty little bells and whistles that seemed to make Macs so much easier to use than a computer that required users to memorize command words, along with &lt;span class=\"bold\"&gt;switches&lt;/span&gt;—letters or words typed in after the command word to control how a DOS function or an application carries out the command.&lt;/p&gt;</div><div>&lt;p&gt;Although there was a strong, loyal market for Mac computers the key factor in Apple’s success, apart from the charisma of Steve Jobs, was its &lt;span class=\"bold\"&gt;graphic user interface (GUI)&lt;/span&gt;, which let users make choices with their mouse by clicking small pictures called &lt;span class=\"bold\"&gt;icons&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</div><div>&lt;figure class=\"left\"&gt;</div><div><span>&lt;img src=\"</span><span>s3/images/5_-1/part02fig06.png\"</span><span>/&gt;</span><br></div><div><span>&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;h1&gt;</span>Windows 1&lt;/h1&gt;In 1985, Microsoft introduced Windows, a graphic interface that let you make selections with a mouse from menus and run more than one program at a time. It was slow, required major memory, and received a universal yawn.&lt;/figcaption&gt;</div><div>&lt;/figure&gt;</div><div>&lt;p&gt;When Microsoft’s own attempt at a graphic interface, Windows, first appeared in November 1985, it was slow, crash-prone, and demanded processing and memory resources that were then prohibitively expensive. It used graphics and a mouse pointer to do the jobs that required obscure typed commands in DOS. It was an unimaginative copycat of the Macintosh operating system. Still, Microsoft, better than any competitor, could guarantee that billions of dollars of software and business data already created under DOS would still be usable.&lt;/p&gt;</div><div>&lt;p&gt;Technically, Windows was at first an “operating environment,” window-dressing that hid the fact that DOS continued to do the dirty work behind the curtains. And the dirtiest of them all was running program code that was originally designed for the PC’s first processor, which could at best manipulate only 16 bits of data at a time. Many programs written for DOS depended on that 16-bit mechanism even after Intel introduced the 80386, which could process 32 bits of data at once. DOS, and even more recent Windows variants like Windows 95, 98, and Me, had to maintain parts of its own code that handled 16-bit operations. Microsoft did develop a variant of Windows—Windows NT, which became Windows 2000—that ran only 32-bit instructions. NT was a more stable variation of Windows, and it’s steadily evolved into the most common versions of Windows we use today, but at the time it couldn’t run older applications designed for older processors.&lt;/p&gt;</div><div>&lt;p&gt;Despite the deservedly cold reception Windows first received, Microsoft kept revising Windows until, with version 3.1 in June 1992, it had an operating system that, although still far from ideal and still tied down by 16-bit code, was fast enough and stable enough to convince the public and software publishers to hop on.&lt;/p&gt;</div><div>&lt;p&gt;In 2001, Windows finally made the big step. Microsoft updated its consumer-oriented OS to a fully 32-bit operating system, giving it speed, features, and security equal to that of Windows 2000. Some software creators still had to rewrite their programs to take advantage of the 32-operations, but for programs that clung to their 16-bit ways, Microsoft gave XP a “compatibility mode” that could still run the older programs. By the close of the decade, most of us had migrated to 64-bit versions of Microsoft’s operating systems, in Windows 7 and 8, that still maintain all of this backward compatibility while also attempting to bridge the gap to an ever-more-mobile world.&lt;/p&gt;</div><div>&lt;p&gt;There have been other operating systems, such as Linux, and non-Microsoft programming languages, such as Java, that were not a serious challenge to Windows—more like annoying gnats circling your head. Linux is a version of Unix, a geeky operating system for high-powered computers. Linux has gained popularity as an example of kumbaya software. It is free, and the underlying code is available to anyone. Other programmers are encouraged to make improvements to the code and share them with fellow Linux users. Linux has the idealism found in the earliest programmers who considered selling software for profit the equivalent of crossing over to the Dark Side. Programmers use Java, developed by Sun Microsystems to create nondenominational software. That is, a program written in Java runs on an IBM PC as well as a Mac or a Linux desktop. All those computers have to have is an &lt;span class=\"bold\"&gt;interpreter&lt;/span&gt; that looks at each line of code in a program and translates the command in each line into something that computer’s OS understands.&lt;/p&gt;</div><div>&lt;p&gt;Even with such competition, it looked for years as if Microsoft and Windows would continue to rule the marketplace. Other operating systems might have their fiefdoms, but Windows was king.&lt;/p&gt;</div><div>&lt;p&gt;And then the Internet became emperor.&lt;/p&gt;</div><div>&lt;p&gt;The Internet created a new space for programs to run, &lt;span class=\"bold\"&gt;clouds&lt;/span&gt; to store information, and ways for computers to communicate with each other and tap into vast storehouses of knowledge. Although Microsoft was looking to the big systems as the most likely threat to grind Windows under their heel, it has actually been little guys of commuting that have taken over and changed how we use computers.&lt;/p&gt;</div><div>&lt;p&gt;The little guys actually are little—the &lt;span class=\"bold\"&gt;tablet&lt;/span&gt; computers, &lt;span class=\"bold\"&gt;smartphones&lt;/span&gt;, which are really just portable computers that you can also use to make phone calls, and wearable computers such as smartwatches, Fitbits, and Google’s &lt;span class=\"bold\"&gt;Glass&lt;/span&gt;. Apple and Microsoft both have dogs in this fight, but the mutt that has exploded from the pack is an &lt;span class=\"bold\"&gt;Android&lt;/span&gt; and it comes from Google.&lt;/p&gt;</div><div>&lt;p&gt;In this part of the book, you first look at the programming languages that software developers use to create other software. You might never use programming languages, but understanding how a program is created can help explain some of the inexplicable eccentricities of your computer. Then you look at applications and how they do the heavy lifting that lets you run an ever-more-complex life just a little bit more simply.&lt;/p&gt;</div><div>&lt;/section&gt;</div>","type":"text",".priority":1}},"chapter":"5","number":"-1","part":"2","title":"Software — The Computer's Own Poetry"},"5_0":{"cells":{"1":{"id":1,"image":"","text":"<div><span>&lt;section&gt;</span><br></div><div>&lt;p&gt;<span>&lt;span class=\"init-cap-words\"&gt;Our&lt;/span&gt;</span><span>&nbsp;most fundamental tool as intelligent beings is language. It is through language that you learn new information and share your knowledge, feelings, and experiences with others. Through language, you can express any thought anyone has ever had and describe any event, real or fictional. The world is controlled through language. Presidents to petty functionaries, generals to GIs, CEOs to clerks—all rely on language to give instructions to others and to gather information.&lt;/p&gt;</span></div><div>&lt;p&gt;Language is a necessity for a computer, too. Software is created using special languages that provide instructions for telling the computer what to do. And language defines the data with which the instructions will work. Computer language is similar to human language in many ways. The nouns, verbs, prepositions, and objects found in English, for example, have their counterparts in programming code—or the source code, the actual lines of text that get translated into functioning programs. But software sentences have their own syntax, and the words that make up the languages have their own precise meanings.&lt;/p&gt;</div><div>&lt;p&gt;Computer language is more exacting and more limited than English. An often-repeated story tells how, in an early attempt to use a computer to translate English into Russian, the phrase “The spirit is willing, but the flesh is weak” was interpreted as “The vodka is ready, but the meat is rotten.” The story might be mythical, but it illustrates a reality—that computers and their languages do not do a good job of managing the ambiguities and shades of meaning in human language that any four-year-old understands (although advances in voice recognition have computers understanding what we say, if not what we mean).&lt;/p&gt;</div><div>&lt;p&gt;If programming languages lack the subtleties of human language, human language cannot match the precision of computer-speak. Try, for example, to describe a simple spiral without using your hands. It’s impossible in English. But because math is an integral part of computer languages, those languages cannot only describe a spiral but also can provide the instructions to create an image of that spiral on a display or printer.&lt;/p&gt;</div><div>&lt;h1&gt;Different Programming Languages&lt;/h1&gt;</div><div>&lt;p&gt;Just as there is more than one language for humans, so is there more than one computer language, even for the same type of computer. Generally, the various languages are described as low-level or high-level. The more a computer language resembles ordinary English, the higher its level. Lower-level languages are more difficult to work with, but they usually produce programs that are smaller and faster.&lt;/p&gt;</div><div>&lt;p&gt;On the lowest level is &lt;span class=\"bold\"&gt;machine language&lt;/span&gt;. This is a series of codes, represented by numbers (ones and zeros), used to communicate directly with the internal instructions of the PC’s microprocessor. Deciphering machine language code or writing it is as complex a task as one can tackle in computing. Luckily, we don’t have to do it. Programs called &lt;span class=\"bold\"&gt;interpreters&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span class=\"bold\"&gt;compilers&lt;/span&gt; translate commands written in higher-level languages into machine language. This chapter covers both interpreters and compilers.&lt;/p&gt;</div><div>&lt;p&gt;On a slightly higher level than machine language is &lt;span class=\"bold\"&gt;assembly language&lt;/span&gt;, or simply &lt;span class=\"bold\"&gt;assembly&lt;/span&gt;, which uses simple command words to supply step-by-step instructions for the processor to carry out. Assembly language directly manipulates the values contained in those memory scratch pads in the microprocessor called &lt;span class=\"bold\"&gt;registers&lt;/span&gt;. In machine language, the hexadecimal code 40 increases by one the value contained in the register named AX; assembly language uses the command INC AX to perform the same function. Although assembly language is more intelligible to humans than machine language codes, assembly is still more difficult to use than higher-level languages. Assembly remains popular among programmers, however, because it creates compact, fast code.&lt;/p&gt;</div><div>&lt;p&gt;On the high end, languages such as C and Java allow programmers to write in words and terms that more closely parallel English. And the programmer using these languages need not be concerned with such minutiae as registers. The C language is powerful and yet reasonably simple to write and understand. Currently, Java is the rising star among languages because a program written in Java runs on any computer no matter what the operating system. This is a distinct advantage when you’re writing programs people will use over the Internet, using anything from PCs to Macs and Sun workstations. Software written in C, in contrast, must be modified to allow a program written for one type of computer to be used on another.&lt;/p&gt;</div><div>&lt;p&gt;At the highest level are languages such as BASIC (Beginners All-purpose Symbolic Instruction Code), Visual Basic, the DOS batch language, and the macro languages used to automate applications such as Microsoft Office and Corel WordPerfect Office.&lt;/p&gt;</div><div>&lt;h1&gt;Software Construction&lt;/h1&gt;</div><div>&lt;p&gt;A program can be a single file—a record of data or program code saved to a disk drive. But generally, complex software consists of one file that contains a master program—the &lt;span class=\"bold\"&gt;kernel&lt;/span&gt;—surrounded by a collection of files that contain subprograms, or &lt;span class=\"bold\"&gt;routines&lt;/span&gt;. The kernel &lt;span class=\"bold\"&gt;calls&lt;/span&gt; the routines it needs to perform some task, such as display a dialog box or open a file. A routine can also call other routines in the same file, in another file that’s part of the program, or in files provided by Windows for common functions. Together, the kernel and subprograms give programs a way to receive, or input, information from the keyboard, memory, ports, and files, rules for handling that input data, and a way to send, or &lt;span class=\"bold\"&gt;output&lt;/span&gt;, information to the screen, memory, ports, and files.&lt;/p&gt;</div><div>&lt;p&gt;Typically, when a user types information into a program, it is stored as a &lt;span class=\"bold\"&gt;variable&lt;/span&gt;. As the term suggests, the information a variable stores varies from one instance to another. Programs on their own are also capable of storing in variables the information based on the results of a calculation or manipulation of data. For example , to assign the value 3 to a variable X, BASIC uses the command X = 3. Assembly language accomplishes the same thing by assigning the value to the AX register with the command MOV AX,3. Some languages require several commands to achieve the same effect another language accomplishes with a single command.&lt;/p&gt;</div><div>&lt;p&gt;After a program has information in a variable, it can manipulate it with commands that perform mathematical operations on numbers or parse text strings. &lt;span class=\"bold\"&gt;Parsing&lt;/span&gt; is the joining, deletion, or extraction of some of the text characters to use them elsewhere in the program. When a variable is text, it is often called a &lt;span class=\"bold\"&gt;string&lt;/span&gt;. You can have math strings, but most often, the term string refers to an uninterrupted series of alphanumeric and punctuation characters. Through parsing, a program can locate, for example, the spaces in the name “Phineas T. Fogg”; determine which parts of the string make up the first name, the middle initial, and the last name; and assign each segment to a separate variable. A typical math manipulation would be X = 2 + 2, which results in the variable X having the value 4. If that command is then followed by X = X + 1, the new value of X would be 5. The command X = “New” + “ “ + “York” assigns the string “New York” to variable X.&lt;/p&gt;</div><div>&lt;p&gt;Programs can rely on the BIOS (see Chapter 3, “How a Microprocessor Juggles Data”) to perform many of the input and output functions—such as recognizing keystrokes, displaying keystrokes onscreen, sending data through the parallel and serial ports, reading and writing to RAM, and reading and writing disk files. The programming language still must have commands to trigger the BIOS services. Consider the following series of BASIC commands:&lt;/p&gt;</div><div><span>&lt;p style=\"font-family : Courier;\"&gt;OPEN “FOO” FOR OUTPUT AS #1&lt;br/&gt;</span></div><div>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;WRITE #1, “This is some text.”&lt;br/&gt;</div><div>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;CLOSE #1&lt;/p&gt;<br></div><div>&lt;p&gt;These commands create a file named FOO that contains the text in quotes: This is some text. It then closes the file. The language Pascal does the same with these commands:&lt;/p&gt;</div><div>&lt;p style=\"font-family : Courier;\"&gt;Assign (TextVariable, “FOO”);&lt;br/&gt;</div><div>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;WriteLn (TextVariable, “This is some text.”);&lt;br/&gt;</div><div>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Close (TextVariable);&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;<br></div><div>&lt;p&gt;So far, I’ve described a fairly straightforward scheme: in, process, out. The reality is more complex. A program must be capable of performing different tasks under different circumstances—a feature that accounts for programming languages’ power and versatility. And because a program hardly ever proceeds in a straight line from start to finish, there are commands that tell the computer to &lt;span class=\"bold\"&gt;branch&lt;/span&gt; to different parts of the program to execute other commands. In BASIC, the command GOTO causes the execution to move to another part of the program. Assembly language does the same with the command JMP (short for jump).&lt;/p&gt;</div><div>&lt;p&gt;Branching is used in combination with the &lt;span class=\"bold\"&gt;Boolean logic&lt;/span&gt; functions of the programming languages. For example, when a program needs to change what it’s doing because a particular condition exists, it can use an “&lt;span class=\"bold\"&gt;if... then...&lt;/span&gt;” statement. The program checks to see whether a certain condition is true, and if it is, the program then performs a certain command. For example, if the variable State is the string “Texas,” the program uses the abbreviation TX to address a letter.&lt;/p&gt;</div><div>&lt;p&gt;So you get an idea of how programs are written, this chapter shows you a &lt;span class=\"bold\"&gt;flowchart&lt;/span&gt;—a kind of map sometimes used by programmers to lay out the logical connections among different sections of the program code. The example uses a type of game that was popular in the days when text-only adventures like Zork were plentiful. In such games, the user types in elementary commands, such as “Go east,” “Go north,” “Take knife,” and “Hit monster.” And the game displays a sentence describing the consequences of the player’s action. The example is oversimplified and takes into account only one small portion of such a game. As such, it gives you an idea of how many commands and how much programming logic go into even the simplest code. In the example adventure, the player is already on the balcony of a castle turret surrounded by Fire Demons….&lt;/p&gt;</div><div>&lt;/section&gt;</div>","type":"text",".priority":1}},"chapter":"5","number":"0","part":"2","title":"How Words Are Stitched into Programs"},"5_1":{"cells":{"1":{"id":1,"image":"interactives/flowchart/flow.html","type":"interactive",".priority":1}},"chapter":"5","keywords":"interactive","number":"1","part":2,"title":"How a Program is a Roadmap"},"5_2":{"cells":{"1":{"id":1,"text":"Some software languages are like world leaders at a global conference.

The long definition of apps encompasses everything from first-person shooter games such as &lt;span class=\"italic\"&gt;Bioshock: Infinite&lt;/span&gt;, to the most strait-laced accounting program, to that app on your phone that tells you how many steps you’ve taken today.&lt;/p&gt;</span><div>&lt;p&gt;The lines between the operating system and apps have grown increasingly blurry in recent years, but there are still applications whose power and scope exceed anything that could be packed into an operating system.

Data can appear in the form of stock prices, addresses, money, dates, statistics, phone numbers, recipes, probabilities, dots of color, pages of text, notes of music, the number of lives left in a game, positions in a virtual world, or your longitude and latitude on Earth. Data are raw facts. Names are data, and so are the letters that make up the word “names.” Even computer code is considered data (which means data is manipulating data, a line of thought that is perilous to pursue). And all data are numbers, even if they’re words or colors.&lt;/p&gt;</div><div>&lt;p&gt;Computerdom has, by mutual consent, agreed on a standard called &lt;span class=\"bold\"&gt;ANSI (American National Standards Institute)&lt;/span&gt;. In ANSI, each letter of the alphabet, punctuation, numbers, and even an empty space is assigned an 8-bit binary number. Eight bits is enough to represent all the decimal numbers between 0 and 255. A capital “A” is 65. A capital “B” is 66. A lowercase “b” is 98. An @ symbol is 64. $ is 36. ? is 63. 1 is 49, and 49 is 52 followed by 57.

Your PC displays the colors on your screen by resorting to some combination of red, blue, and green—the only pure colors a display can create. With only 256 values representing 256 shades each of red, blue, and green, your monitor can produce more colors than most eyes can distinguish.&lt;/p&gt;</div><div>&lt;p&gt;No matter what kind of data you feed into a computer, the PC ultimately sees it only as numbers, strings of zeroes and ones written with transistors in the microchips of your motherboard. The decimal numbers of ANSI are converted to binary. A capital “A” becomes 01000001. A lowercase “b” is 01100010.

Breaking into a megacorporation’s servers, leaving a virus, or substituting a screen of his own scatological design for the company’s home page—that’s done by someone who wants attention. They can’t resist leaving a program or note that’s a digital sign of Zorro, something to let you know that although you might own the computer, the cracker owns its soul.&lt;/p&gt;</div><div>&lt;p&gt;I’m using the term &lt;span class=\"bold\"&gt;cracker&lt;/span&gt; here instead of &lt;span class=\"bold\"&gt;hacker&lt;/span&gt;, which most people think of when they hear about some teenager who broke into the high school’s computer and gave himself a lot of As. Self-described hackers break into computer systems out of curiosity or to test their skills without stealing information and without trashing the hacked system. Hackers look down on crackers as immature, unsophisticated kiddies.&lt;/p&gt;</div><div>&lt;p&gt;Crackers and hackers have one thing in common: Both must have endless patience and a dedication to their life’s calling that you rarely find outside of a monastery. It means starting as a script kiddie, running program scripts written by others that sniff and nudge and try to bluff their way past a computer’s defenses. The world of hacking is ultra-cool and ultra-exclusive. You will only be admitted—make that tolerated—when you show that you’ve mastered those scripts and even written some of your own. You might take on a monster crack to prove you’re up to snuff.&lt;/p&gt;</div><div>&lt;p&gt;The act of proving oneself is the undoing of many crackers. It’s difficult to do a crack and leave no clues behind—if only because the up-and-coming cracker just has to let someone know he did it. The only payoff in this game is recognition. The only way you earn it is to have encyclopedic knowledge of network security, including all the holes and back entrances that not even the people running a network know about.&lt;/p&gt;</div><div><span>&lt;p&gt;Although no system, from a home PC to an Internet-connected corporate supercomputer, is truly crack-proof—just ask Sony or Target—as a user there are tools at your disposal that help you keep control of your PC.

These utilities help you keep control of your PC where it belongs—in your hands.&lt;/p&gt;</span></div><div><span>&lt;p&gt;Still, the next time you tune in to the news and learn about a new virus, a denial-of-service attack that overwhelms an organization’s incoming lines, or a crash that spreads like a California wildfire, remember this: These aren’t the truly scary cyber-attacks. You can always replace your credit card or change your password. A really dangerous cracker, however, keeps his activities secret, and limits himself to, say, small transfers of money, none so large as to attract attention. When the real master cracker comes along, no one knows anything’s going on. In fact, it could be going on right now, but you’ll never really know if he’s stopped.&lt;/p&gt;</span></div><div><span>&lt;/section&gt;</span></div>","type":"text",".priority":1}},"chapter":"8","number":"0","part":"2","title":"How Security Software Fights Off Invaders"},"8_1":{"cells":{"1":{"id":1,"number":"1","text":"Unlike in movies, where hackers break into a computer in minutes with only a few keystrokes, hacking deep enough into a computer to take control of it might take days or weeks.

When we think of evolution, we think of the eons it took fish to emerge from the waters and walk, or crawl, or slither, or whatever they did to become full-fledged land lubbers. Dinosaurs dominated Earth for millennia before a giant asteroid hit and created the Gulf of Mexico, along with enough dirt and debris to envelope the world for years, cutting off the sunlight plants needed—the same plants the dinosaurs needed. The dying strains of dinosaurs gave earth its first birds, which evolved into the 10,000 species of little feathered dinosaurs we have today. Also among the survivors were &lt;span class=\"bold\"&gt;synapsids&lt;/span&gt;, creatures that, over 65 million years, evolved into the mammals we know today, including ourselves.&lt;/p&gt;</div><div>&lt;p&gt;Evolution is not limited to plants and animals. Non-living systems such as languages and societies evolve. Even rocks evolve. What begins as a layer of shells and bone left behind by deceased sea creatures experiences a few million years of pressure created by its own weight to turn into limestone. A few more million years of pressure morphs the limestone into marble. Still more years pass, and it turns into a bathroom countertop.&lt;/p&gt;</div><div>&lt;p&gt;The changes that rock undergoes might not qualify as true evolution because the concept of &lt;span class=\"bold\"&gt;survival of the fittest&lt;/span&gt; does not come into play. However, survival of the fittest does rule in the evolution of computers, where survival sometimes comes with a cutthroat viciousness that rivals any terrors of the Jurassic age. Evolutional changes may dawdle about for eons in the biological world, technological evolution comes with a swiftness that often brings the Next Big Thing before we’ve paid off the Previous Big Thing.&lt;/p&gt;</div><div>&lt;p&gt;The reason for the speed is that unlike the biological evolution, where changes in species, for better or worse, come from random, spontaneous mutations, evolutionary changes in technology come from conscious, deliberate decisions by inventors, engineers, software developers, and the wily, poison-spitting raptors of our age—marketeers. They are the trail bosses of guided evolution, making both minor and major changes on the fly, all to fight off attacks by rivals while still planning a safe and profitable route for their creations to follow a decade ahead.&lt;/p&gt;</div><div>&lt;p&gt;Just because there’s no directing intelligence in biological evolution, that doesn’t mean a planned, deliberate change in hardware and software always works the way it was envisioned, or that even if it does work, that it will turn out to be a good idea. Embellishing mice by putting a scroll wheel and buttons to navigate through web pages was a splendid idea—a survivor trait. Replacing the mouse, as someone really did about 20 years ago, with two foot pedals, one to move the cursor up and down and the other to move it sideways, was a terrible idea, and it became extinct faster than you can say &lt;span class=\"italics\"&gt;Galapagos&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</div><div>&lt;p&gt;That ridiculous mouse replacement was not alone. Extinction is the norm in technological development. When IBM launched its Personal Computer in 1987, it was an instant success because it had mutated small computers from toys for hobbyists into tools for business. Made from off-the-shelf components, it was affordable for those pining to have their own computers. But IBM’s strategy that laid bare the machine’s DNA led to a viral breakout of IBM clones. Within a few years, there were dozens of IBM imitations, some better, some cheaper, some both. The battle for survival was intense. The IBM PC was one of the non-survivors, although its ghost lives on at Lenovo, the Chinese company that bought rights to its laptop progeny. The chart on this page shows who today is at the top of the food chain.&lt;/p&gt;</div><div><span>&lt;img class=\"right\" src=\"</span><span>s3/images/9_-1/part03fig01.png</span><span>\"/&gt;</span></div><div>&lt;p&gt;The initial eruption of PCs was followed by an aftershock of software. The first word processor to gain wide popularity was the cleverly named Electric Pencil, created for the Apple in 1976. Its fate should be a lesson to you that cleverness doesn’t take you all that far. By 1979 Electric Pencil had fallen to WordStar, whose power and versatility kept it on top until WordPerfect beat WordStar and 55 other word processors in 1986. Arguably, by me anyway, still the best word processor to crawl out of the program primeval. WordPerfect lost its dominance to Microsoft Word and Microsoft’s marketing muscle, proof that “fittest” can trump “best” in the battle for survival.&lt;/p&gt;</div><div>&lt;p&gt;WordPerfect is still a survivor, but a good rule of thumb is that any technology rises to the top only so it has a good spot to take a fall. (The big exceptions are Intel’s microprocessors, although &lt;span class=\"bold\"&gt;ARM processors&lt;/span&gt; are gaining as Android grows in popularity.) The electronic spreadsheet Visicalc which alone justified the purchase of millions of personal computers, is extinct, killed off by Lotus 1-2-3, which fell in turn to Excel. The browser Internet Explorer pushed Netscape out of its cat-bird seat, but Explorer now has Firefox and Chrome gnawing at its heels. The small computer operating system CP/M was perfectly positioned to become the OS of choice on the new IBM PCs, but a simple twist of fate&lt;span class=\"super\"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt; gave that role to MS-DOS, which evolved into Windows, which is itself fast losing ground to Android in an increasingly mobile world.&lt;/p&gt;</div><div>&lt;p&gt;Today, the Internet is the massive asteroid that is changing the technological ecosystem by choking old tech and opening up fresh ranges for new tech. Although Windows is hardly an endangered species (yet), Google’s Android operating system thrives in the Web world, along with microprocessors designed for mobile computing. These are the beasts to watch. This part of How Computers Work is devoted to revealing the way that technology evolves, where it came from, and what it’s evolved into, without going into the shock and awe of marketing. Said marketing is influential but beyond the scope of a book bound with technology and steeped in physics rather than the fiscal.&lt;/p&gt;</div><div>&lt;/section&gt;</div><div><span>&lt;footer&gt;</span><br></div><div>&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=\"super\"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt; Interesting aside: CP/M was the creation of the late Gary Kildall, and had no serious rivals in the pre-IBM PC microcomputer market. Naturally, IBM wanted to talk to Kildall about modifying CP/M to run on its new computer. But when IBM executives went to see him, Kildall was out of the office flying his plane. The person in charge, Kildall’s wife, Dorothy, didn’t like the non-disclosure agreements the IBM suits insisted on, and so IBM approached this other guy, Bill Gates, who had had a modest success with a programming language, BASIC.&lt;/p&gt;</div><div>&lt;p&gt;IBM asked Gates if he had an operating system that could be made to run with the Intel 8086 processor that would be the heart of their new computer. Gates knew that the fittest don’t survive by saying they can’t do something. So he told them, “Yes,” and quickly paid $50,000 to programmer Tim Patterson, who had developed an operating system adaptable to the 8086 with the name QDOS, for Quick and Dirty Operating System. (Really.) And the rest was not only history. It was survival.&lt;/p&gt;</div><div>&lt;/footer&gt;</div><div><br></div>","type":"step",".priority":1}},"chapter":"9","number":"-1","part":"3","title":"How Computers Evolve"},"9_0":{"cells":{"1":{"id":1,"image":"","text":"<div><span>&lt;section&gt;</span><br></div><div>&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=\"init-cap-words\"&gt;Just as&lt;/span&gt; we carbon-based units have an ancestry that began some hundreds of thousands of years ago, computing has an ancestry—not nearly as long, but just as important when it comes to understanding the workings of the digital machines we use today. Some of the nomenclature doesn’t make sense without knowing a word’s genealogy. Hard drives are so named because they evolved from something we rarely see today, a floppy drive. Why are CDs called “compact” discs? Because they are the offspring of video discs the size of LP-sized vinyl records.&lt;/p&gt;</div><div>&lt;p&gt;Random access memory (RAM) seems like an unnecessary term. First of all, it seems like it is memory designed for someone with attention deficit syndrome—someone who keeps flitting from data in memory one place to a totally unrelated data at another location. But RAM is more understandable when you know that before memory chips and floppy and hard drives, programs and data were usually stored on magnetic tape a lot like the tape in video cassettes (another fossil). Just as you couldn’t hop from the start to the middle of a video tape, computer users from the ancient days, who wanted some bit of data stored only at the end of a gigantic roll of magnetic tape, had to fast forward through hundreds of inches of tape to get what they were after.&lt;/p&gt;</div><div>&lt;p&gt;But DNA is not just nomenclature. Just like you don’t get an elephant without there first having been a mastodon, without many of the fossils of the premobilian era we wouldn’t have the kinds of computers, phones, TVs, tablets, printers, cars, medical devices— the list is endless—that we have today.&lt;/p&gt;</div><div>&lt;p&gt;When you look at some fossils, they seem so primitive you’re amazed anyone ever used them. The first modems sent text (only) over phone lines so slowly you could watch as e a c h &nbsp;c h a r a c t e r &nbsp;a p p e a r e d. But to those who never previously had the ability to send written messages on a phone line, the creeping words were just terrific! And without them, we wouldn’t have the Internet we have today.&lt;/p&gt;</div><div>&lt;p&gt;There’s another lesson to be learned by digging up digital bones: What inventions that today seem, well, kinda lame or too limited—such as 3D printers and 3D TV, voice recognition, artificial intelligence, and household robots—are most likely the future ancestors of technology about which our own carbon descendants will wonder how we ever got along without them.
