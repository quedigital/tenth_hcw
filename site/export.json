From that need and from hand-held players such as the GameBoy came today’s most prevalent controller—a device studded with buttons and pads, and held with two hands, as if at any moment it might try to escape.

The graphics processing unit on the video card (or cards) has a <span class=\"glossary\">geometry engine</span> that calculates the height, width, and depth information for each corner of every polygon in a 3D environment, a process called <span class=\"glossary\">tessellation</span>, or <span class=\"glossary\">triangulation</span>. The engine also figures out the current camera angle, or vantage point, which determines what part of a setting can be seen. For each frame, it rotates, resizes, or repositions the triangles as the viewpoint changes. Any lines outside the viewpoint are eliminated, or <span class=\"glossary\">clipped</span>. The engine also calculates the position of any <span class=\"glossary\">light sources </span>in relation to the polygons. Tessellation makes intense use of floating-point math. Without video cards with processors designed specifically for 3D graphics, the primary Pentium and Athlon CPUs in the computers would be woefully overtaxed. A changing scene must be redrawn at least 15 to 20 times a second for the eye to see smooth movement.","type":"step",".priority":4},"4":{"id":4,"image":"https://res.cloudinary.com/hcw10/image/upload/v1407250037/7_1/Geometry_1_v2.svg","number":"1","text":"The results of the geometry engine’s calculations—the threedimensional location of each vertex in the camera’s viewing range—are passed to the <span class=\"glossary\">rendering engine</span>, another part of the <span class=\"glossary\">graphics processing unit (GPU)</span>.

A pixel is drawn only if its value is lower than that of all the other pixels along line AB. In the illustration here of z-buffering, pixel A is the only one the engine bothers to draw because pixels in the house, mountain, and sun along line AB would be covered by pixel A.
