You never see them. You see only what they do—like a lamp thrown to the floor by a poltergeist. And computers, from PCs to a Galaxy S phone, tightly tuck away their secrets. You have to keep asking “Why?” And if you ask long enough, you get into physical states filled with objects so small you can’t see them, or that exist only in ghostly states, such as the vast parts of the electromagnetic spectrum or some screwy spinning quantum string, all of which are invisible to mere humans.&lt;/p&gt;</div><div>&lt;p&gt;The only way to even get a hint about what these little ghosts are like is to fling them around in giant, mile-wide magnets like the Large Hadron Collider, until they smash into each other and create even smaller, rarer ghosts that vanish as soon as they appear.

An indicator of how inaccurate a clepsydra was is the fact that a sundial was used to make corrections in the water clock’s time-keeping.

The wheel then bounces back enough to throw off the first hook and turns a bit before the second catch hook descends to stop the wheel from the other side.

Certainly it’s not anything you can see: They both have a lens, most have some sort of viewfinder to peer through, and they have similar assortments of buttons and knobs.&lt;/p&gt;</div><div>&lt;p&gt;The important difference between the two cameras is buried inside them. Take off the back of the film camera and you’ll see a slot at one end where you insert your cassette of film and an empty spool on the other end to take up the roll of film as each frame is exposed. Between them is the shutter. When the camera back is closed, the film is held firmly against the frame around the shutter by a smooth flat surface called the pressure plate. Take a digital camera and open the back—and you can’t! There is no way to open it and see what’s inside. This chapter shows you what you ordinarily can’t see on your own—that your digital camera is, in fact, a very specialized computer. It has a &lt;span class=\"bold\"&gt;microchip&lt;/span&gt; packed with microscopic transistors that process data just like the processor of your desktop PC or even your smartphone (which itself probably has a pretty good digital camera).&lt;/p&gt;</div><div>&lt;p&gt;This particular type of microchip, as you see in more detail later in the book, is covered with a special type of transistor—millions of transistors, actually—that is sensitive to light and converts that light into electricity. The chip is called an &lt;span class=\"bold\"&gt;image sensor&lt;/span&gt;, or an &lt;span class=\"bold\"&gt;imager&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</div><div>&lt;p&gt;The image sensor’s ability to translate different colors and intensities of light into constantly changing electrical currents is what accounts for the other important differences between digital and film cameras. The most obvious is that most digital cameras have an LCD screen on the back of them, like a tiny TV set, where the camera displays the scene to be shot or the photographs already stored in the camera. The LCD has its own array of transistors that do just the opposite of the imager’s transistors: They convert electricity into light. (More about that, too, later on.)&lt;/p&gt;</div><div>&lt;p&gt;If you inspect the two cameras closely enough, you might find some other differences. The digital camera might have, for example, a button or switch for something called white balance. It might have controls for onscreen menus, or for displaying information about a shot you’ve snapped, or a button with an icon of a trash can that’s used for deleting files.&lt;/p&gt;</div><div>&lt;p&gt;But that’s about it. Those are all the differences you’ll find by visually inspecting your digital camera—even if you tear it apart. With few exceptions, such as the aforementioned white balance, you use a digital camera just as you would a film camera.&lt;/p&gt;</div><div>&lt;p&gt;But after you click the shutter, letting light fleetingly strike the image sensor, you’ve created not just one picture, but the possibility for scores of pictures.

Things sure changed in a hurry, didn’t they? Oh, sure. The first desktops only made you a hero if you were the office geek who knew how to get them running after a crash, but then PCs shrank and evolved into tablets and smartphones and watches and glasses. Computer makers and users realized these mobile gadgets were more than office appliances or at-home game machines. They could give us the power to be interconnected, all the time.

We can see, as never before, through a built-in camera’s high definition resolution, one that perfectly balances all the strengths of light in a scene into a photo in which nothing is lost in shadows or washed out in highlights. Computing allows us to create and listen to music made with sounds we—the world—had never heard before, and our favorite apps know what music we’d like before we know. Capturing electromagnetic waves millions of years old, from galaxies millions of light years away, gives us fantastic images in glowing colors with a cast of billions of stars, the existence of which we could only guess at before computing came along.

Like some one-celled organism limited to doing the ultimate minimum to exist at all, early PC sound was a one-note beep. It could not be any less of a sound and still be a sound at all.&lt;/p&gt;</div><div>&lt;p&gt;When you turned on your computer, if it made only one beep, all was well. If it beeped anywhere from two to five times in various patterns of long and short beeps, it was a warning something was wrong. You started rummaging through your stuff looking for a user’s manual that could decipher the beep codes. It didn’t matter much if you found it or not. Most combinations of beeps meant the same thing: Something’s wrong with either your motherboard or your power supply. The exact problem was up to you to figure out. And good luck.&lt;/p&gt;</div><div>&lt;p&gt;Beeping remained the state of the art in PC audio for several years, even after adapter cards brought graphics to what had been text-only systems. Graphics meant games, and games are a lot more fun with rousing music, the sounds of gun fire and explosions, and characters who actually speak. And yet, the first graphic-endowed computers had not a whisper of any of these. One software maker released a screen saver featuring flying toasters shooting at each other. The best sound effect they could come up with for the gunfire was to make the floppy drive’s read/write arm swing back and forth wildly, producing a sound vaguely like that of a machine gun.&lt;/p&gt;</div><div>&lt;p&gt;Third-party card makers eventually started offering audio cards that filtered and amplified sounds to be sent to cheap speakers. Game makers studied the cards to figure out how to add sounds to their programs. Although it was better than nothing, it still wasn’t as good as something.&lt;/p&gt;</div><div>&lt;p&gt;What finally brought decent sound to computers was the iPod and MP3 recordings. Suddenly just about any tune you’d want to listen to could be ripped from a CD, swapped from a friend, or downloaded from the Internet. As handy as the early iPods were, the 5GB drive on the first iPod held only 1,000 songs, which might sound like a lot until you try to cram the complete discography of Dave Matthews or The Grateful Dead on it. The vast world of music on MP3s demanded vastly larger drives to hold it all. And that meant a desktop PC.&lt;/p&gt;</div><div>&lt;p&gt;Since then, computer audio has become the audio of choice, partly because of the magnificently improved audio quality, storage capacity, and—for dedicated collectors—the ability to catalog everything from variations of the same song to artist covers to lyrics.&lt;/p&gt;</div><div>&lt;/section&gt;</div>","type":"text",".priority":1}},"chapter":"16","number":"0","part":"4","title":"How Computers Tickle Your Ears"},"16_1":{"cells":{"1":{"id":1,"text":"It used to be if you went around talking to your computer, you might be in for some heavy rehab.

They came up with the idea of a distributed network called ARPAnet, built around something called interface message processor (IMP), which connected computers at university research centers. IMP also incorporated a technology called TCP/ IP, developed at the National Science Foundation. Standing for transmission control protocol/Internet protocol, TCP/IP calls for breaking up messages and data into packets to which addressing information, error correction code, and identification are added. The packets can all travel to their destinations over the distributed network, and a computer on the other end checks for mistakes and pieces them together in the right order. In 1969, computers at universities all over the country were linked to ARPAnet. The first letter sent over the new network was an “L” sent from UCLA to the Stanford Research Institute.</span><span style=\"line-height: 25.2000007629395px;\">&lt;/p&gt;</span></div><div><span style=\"line-height: 25.2000007629395px;\">&lt;p&gt;</span><span style=\"line-height: 1.4;\">The ARPAnet continued to expand until, in 1972, it connected 23 host sites. By 1975, one new installation was being added each month. Meanwhile, other types of networks, such as the Computer Science Network (CSNET), designed to be a less-expensive version of ARPAnet, sprang up across the country. In 1974, researcher Bob Kahn and Vint Cerf came up with the idea of a “network of networks” that would let dissimilar networks communicate with one another. By 1982, different networks were adopting TCP/IP as their communications standard, and the term “Internet” was used for the first time. A year later, a gateway was set up between CSNET and ARPAnet using TCP/IP as a common standard so people on the two networks could communicate with each other.</span><span style=\"line-height: 25.2000007629395px;\">&lt;/p&gt;</span></div><div><span style=\"line-height: 25.2000007629395px;\">&lt;p&gt;</span><span style=\"line-height: 1.4;\">A high-speed (56Kbps) backbone was built by the NSF to connect five supercomputing centers. Because all the transmission time wasn’t used, the NSF agreed to let local networks connect to each other through the backbone. The Internet was born, even if people didn’t realize it yet. For years, the Internet was the territory of colleges and defense contractors. As the Internet grew, many of the people who nursed it through its infancy were dismayed when, in 1991, the NSF lifted restrictions on the commercial use of the Net.</span><span style=\"line-height: 25.2000007629395px;\">&lt;/p&gt;</span></div><div><span style=\"line-height: 25.2000007629395px;\">&lt;figure class=\"right\"&gt;</span></div><div><span style=\"line-height: 1.4;\">&lt;img src=\"</span><span style=\"line-height: 25.2000007629395px;\">https://s3.amazonaws.com/HCW10/Images/17_-1/part05fig02.png</span><span style=\"line-height: 1.4;\">\"</span><span style=\"line-height: 25.2000007629395px;\">/&gt;</span><span style=\"line-height: 25.2000007629395px;\"><br></span></div><div><span style=\"line-height: 25.2000007629395px;\">&lt;figcaption&gt;</span>The first Internet message, although probably no one at the time realized it, was duly noted in a handwritten log at UCLA on Oct. 29, 1969.&lt;/figcaption&gt;</div><div>&lt;/figure&gt;</div><div><span style=\"line-height: 25.2000007629395px;\">&lt;p&gt;</span><span style=\"line-height: 1.4;\">The first time someone sent out advertising over the Internet—a practice destined to earn the name spam—elicited reactions among Internet purists that were angry and vocal. And equally futile. The Internet and the World Wide Web, a section of the Internet developed to lift it out of its text-only origins and into the world of graphics, sound, and video, had lives of their own. The imp was out of the bottle, and today what started as a modest experiment in communicating is growing at a rate of 100% to 200% a year.</span><span style=\"line-height: 25.2000007629395px;\">&lt;/p&gt;</span></div><div><span style=\"line-height: 25.2000007629395px;\">&lt;p&gt;</span><span style=\"line-height: 1.4;\">Looking back over the last half century, you find that in no other part of computerdom, is it easier to see evolution in technology than in the Internet. The evolution of other parts of computing are hidden in distant origins, in the microscopic scale at which some mutations take place, and in the mind of engineers better at creating technology than explaining it. But the Internet is something we’ve experienced directly, even when it was still a gleam in the eye of the technocrats who created it.</span><span style=\"line-height: 25.2000007629395px;\">&lt;/p&gt;</span></div><div><span style=\"line-height: 25.2000007629395px;\">&lt;p&gt;</span><span style=\"line-height: 1.4;\">In 1964, the Internet was still gestating, but we already had networks linking computers at a single location. A year later, networks spread to connect different locations. For several years, the infant Internet was the province of scientists and universities. In 1969, the first commercial online service, CompuServe, started up, but it wouldn’t be until 1981, when the first modem was marketed, that the concept of communicating with anyone anywhere through computers became a phenomenon. That first 300 BAUD modem was so painfully slow that you could speak out loud each of the letters of a message as it popped onscreen and never fall behind. But that didn’t matter. You could converse, download programs, play games, and send email—all in real time. We had seen the Internet, and there was no holding it back. The world has shrunk several times since then.</span><span style=\"line-height: 25.2000007629395px;\">&lt;/p&gt;</span></div><div><span style=\"line-height: 25.2000007629395px;\">&lt;figure class=\"right\"&gt;</span></div><div><span style=\"line-height: 1.4;\">&lt;img src=\"</span><span style=\"line-height: 25.2000007629395px;\">https://s3.amazonaws.com/HCW10/Images/17_-1/part05fig03.png</span><span style=\"line-height: 1.4;\">\"</span><span style=\"line-height: 25.2000007629395px;\">/&gt;</span><span style=\"line-height: 25.2000007629395px;\"><br></span></div><div><span style=\"line-height: 25.2000007629395px;\">&lt;figcaption&gt;</span>The Internet’s missing link.

AOL has vanished as one of the first major Internet players to become AOL Time-Warner, an 800-pound gorilla in a new, entertainment arm of the Internet. Few know the name of the first browser, Netscape, other than veterans of the Net. What once was a text-only Internet is now dominated by photos, graphic design, audio, and video. A program originally created by a college student so he could remember things about other students in his dorm is now Facebook, the colossus of the Net.</span><span style=\"line-height: 25.2000007629395px;\">&lt;/p&gt;</span></div><div><span style=\"line-height: 25.2000007629395px;\">&lt;p&gt;</span><span style=\"line-height: 1.4;\">Despite all we’ve seen the Internet do and our daily use of it, the Net still holds its mysteries created by sheer vastness and by complex technology. It would be a lot easier to explain how the Internet works if you could hold it in your hand. Hardware—real, tangible, with a weight and size— is always easier to understand because you can see it and you can point with confidence to say this gizmo leads to that gadget, every time. The Internet is not just a single thing; it is an abstract system. It’s like your body.</span><span style=\"line-height: 25.2000007629395px;\">&lt;/p&gt;</span></div><div><span style=\"line-height: 25.2000007629395px;\">&lt;figure class=\"left\"&gt;</span></div><div><span style=\"line-height: 1.4;\">&lt;img src=\"</span><span style=\"line-height: 25.2000007629395px;\">https://s3.amazonaws.com/HCW10/Images/17_-1/part05fig04.png</span><span style=\"line-height: 1.4;\">\"</span><span style=\"line-height: 25.2000007629395px;\">/&gt;</span><span style=\"line-height: 25.2000007629395px;\"><br></span></div><div><span style=\"line-height: 25.2000007629395px;\">&lt;figcaption&gt;</span>Traffic on the Internet by 2018 is estimated by Cisco to grow to 131.9 exabytes a month. An exabyte is 1,000,000,000,000,000,000 bytes. Or you can look at it this way. By 2018 the gigabyte equivalent of all movies ever made will cross the global Internet every three minutes. In 1992 the Internet carried about 100GB of traffic each day.&lt;/figcaption&gt;</div><div>&lt;/figure&gt;</div><div><span style=\"line-height: 25.2000007629395px;\">&lt;p&gt;</span><span style=\"line-height: 1.4;\">As a system, the Internet is similar to a living organism. It grows, taking in new “molecules” in the form of PCs and networks that attach themselves to the Net and abandon it without warning. The Net is ephemeral. Some pieces— the supercomputers that form the backbone of the Internet—are always there. Businesses’ local area networks (LANs) , home networks, individual computers, and smartphones connected through cell phone airwaves all qualify as individual organs in the Body Internet. But nothing is really fixed in place—hard-wired. Each time you use your computer or smartphone to check email messages, leave a quip on Twitter, bid on a Rolex knock-off, or play World of Warcraft, the information you send and receive may travel via phone land lines, T3 networks, Wi-Fi, satellites, and cell phone signals. The first Tweet you send today might be routed through Chicago and Phoenix before it arrives at its destination in San Diego. Your next message might run though San Antonio, Copenhagen, and a satellite. Without realizing it, you can bounce back and forth among several networks from one end of the country to the other, across an ocean and back again, until you reach your destination in cyberspace.</span><span style=\"line-height: 25.2000007629395px;\">&lt;/p&gt;</span></div><div><span style=\"line-height: 25.2000007629395px;\">&lt;p&gt;</span><span style=\"line-height: 1.4;\">It’s a lot easier to say what you can get from the Internet—information of all kinds. Being a system without physical limitations, it’s theoretically possible for the Net to include all information on all computers everywhere, which in this age means essentially everything the human race knows (or thinks it knows). But because the Net is such an ad-hoc system, exploring it can be a challenge. And you don’t always find exactly what you want. There are still multiple “standards” that browser, Web designer, and hardware developers quarrel over, and some who strike out on their own convinced they have the one, true design for the Internet to follow. The result is that when you jump into the Internet, you’re pretty much on your own. With experience, you learn the tricks and secrets buried in browsers, websites, and the Web’s bottom feeders—spam, viruses, and scams. The Internet can be frustrating and even dangerous, but the rewards are so great that all the drawbacks are worth it.&lt;/p&gt;</span></div><div>&lt;/section&gt;</div>","type":"text",".priority":1}},"chapter":"17","number":"-1","part":"5","title":"The Little Net That Grew"},"17_0":{"cells":{"1":{"id":1,"image":"","text":"<span style=\"line-height: 1.4;\">&lt;img class=\"center\" src=\"</span>https://s3.amazonaws.com/HCW10/Images/17_0/1700_thumbnail.png<span style=\"line-height: 1.4;\">\"</span><span style=\"line-height: 25.2000007629395px;\">/&gt;</span><div><span style=\"line-height: 25.2000007629395px;\">&lt;section&gt;</span></div><div>&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=\"init-cap-words\"&gt;A Local Area Network (LAN)&lt;/span&gt; is, for many people, the entry point to the Internet. A LAN physically links several PCs to each other and often to a server that hosts shared data or provides access to the Internet. This is accomplished with a variety of materials—twisted-wire cables, fiber optics, copper phone lines, and even infrared light and radio signals.&lt;/p&gt;</div><div>&lt;p&gt;Whatever the technology, the goal is the same—to send data from one place to another. Usually, the data is in the form of a message from one computer to another. The message might be a query for data, the reply to another PC’s data request, an instruction to run a program that’s stored on the network, or a message to be forwarded to the Internet. If the data or program for which the message asks isn’t on the Internet, it might be stored on a PC used by a coworker on the network, or on a &lt;span class=\"bold\"&gt;file server&lt;/span&gt;, which is a specialized computer with multiple large hard drives that are not used exclusively by any individual on the network. Instead, it exists only to serve all the other PCs using the network—called &lt;span class=\"bold\"&gt;clients&lt;/span&gt;—by providing a common place to store data that can be retrieved as rapidly as possible by the clients. Similarly, a network might include an Internet server that links the LAN to the World Wide Web, or &lt;span class=\"bold\"&gt;print servers&lt;/span&gt; that everyone on the LAN can use for printing.&lt;/p&gt;</div><div>&lt;p&gt;If a network does not have a dedicated server, it is a &lt;span class=\"bold\"&gt;peer-to-peer network&lt;/span&gt;. In a peer-to-peer network, each individual’s PC (or device) acts as a server to other devices—its peers—on the network and also is a client to all its peers acting as servers. This is the kind of network you probably have at home, and it includes everything from that desktop PC in your office, to your laptop, tablet, smartphone, DVR, and Wi-Fi thermostat.&lt;/p&gt;</div><div>&lt;p&gt;The network must receive requests for access to it from individual computers, or &lt;span class=\"bold\"&gt;nodes&lt;/span&gt;, linked to the network, and the network must have a way of handling simultaneous requests for its services. When a computer has the services of the network, the network needs a way of sending a message from one node to another so that only the node for which it’s intended recognizes it, and it doesn’t pop up on some other unsuspecting PC or device. And the network must do all this as quickly as possible while spreading its services as evenly as possible among all the nodes on the LAN. LANs are a microcosm of the Internet, even as the LANs are a part of the Internet.&lt;/p&gt;</div><div>&lt;p&gt;This chapter looks at the most common types of networks.&lt;/p&gt;</div><div>&lt;/section&gt;</div>","type":"text",".priority":1}},"chapter":"17","number":"0","part":"5","title":"How Networks Tie Computers Together"},"17_1":{"cells":{"1":{"id":1,"image":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/HCW10/Images/17_1/network_interface.svg","text":"<span class=\"glossary\"></span><span class=\"glossary\"></span><span class=\"glossary\"></span><span class=\"glossary\"></span><span class=\"glossary\"></span><span class=\"glossary\"></span><span class=\"glossary\"></span><span class=\"glossary\"></span><span class=\"glossary\"></span><span class=\"glossary\"></span><span class=\"glossary\"></span>To become part of a network, a computer or device uses a <span class=\"glossary\">network interface</span>\nto communicate with the local network’s <span class=\"glossary\">backbone</span>, the part of the\nnetwork that carries the most traffic.

No matter that virtually any book, movie, or song can be found, somewhere, on the Net. And it doesn’t mean a thing that every one of your friends, from the first person you met in kindergarten on up, can be reached through the Internet.&lt;/p&gt;</div><div>&lt;p&gt;Everything about your Internet experience derives from how you get all that data down that last mile to your computer. And not all last miles are the same. The technologies of DSL and cable, the two most common Internet connections, tout themselves sending data at various maximum speeds. Whatever those speeds are, they are the dreams of the engineers and marketers. It’s like me saying I can run four miles a minute—and I can, but only for about 10 feet. The reason I don’t live up to my specs is that I’ve been out of shape since the sixth grade. Internet providers have their own reasons why real broadband doesn’t match advertised broadband.&lt;/p&gt;</div><div>&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=\"bold\"&gt;REASON 1: Latency.&lt;/span&gt; Latency is idling time. Your car may be able to go 200 mph on a straightaway, but that doesn’t mean you’ll drive the 200 miles from Houston to San Antonio in an hour. You’ll have to sit still, engine idling, at stop signs, yields, train crossings, red lights, and school crossings. At best, legally, you’ll be able to drive 70 mph because of a roadway latency called a speed limit. It you make the trip in less than two hours then somewhere along the way, you broke the law.&lt;/p&gt;</div><div><span style=\"line-height: 1.4;\">&lt;p&gt;The Internet has its own set of laws, the most fundamental of which is the speed of light. Nothing moves faster than that, although satellite Internet transmissions come close—until they transfer to earthbound channels. Light in empty space requires roughly 5 ms to travel 1,000 miles. Most ground long-distance Internet traffic also uses light in fiber optic cable, but it doesn’t move as quickly as in outer space. Refraction—the bending of light waves—lengthens the time it takes data to travel 1,000 miles in fiber optic to 7.5ms. Generally satellite lag time is 50–100ms for every packet of data.&lt;/p&gt;</span></div><div><span style=\"line-height: 1.4;\">&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=\"bold\"&gt;REASON 2: Use of wireless.&lt;/span&gt; Wi-Fi has more latency and is more susceptible to radio interference than a wired Ethernet connection.&lt;/p&gt;</span></div><div><span style=\"line-height: 1.4;\">&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=\"bold\"&gt;REASON 3: Malware.&lt;/span&gt; A network worm or virus that interferes with a computer’s network interface steals performance time, if nothing else.&lt;/p&gt;</span></div><div><span style=\"line-height: 1.4;\">&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=\"bold\"&gt;REASON 4: Application overload.&lt;/span&gt; Running other applications while you’re surfing slows transmission times by competing with your browser for the CPU’s attention.&lt;/p&gt;</span></div><div><span style=\"line-height: 1.4;\">&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=\"bold\"&gt;REASON 5: Overloaded router or modem.&lt;/span&gt; If you’re not the only one in your household connected to the Internet, your communications may take twice as long—or longer—as you wait others’ requests to be processed.&lt;/p&gt;</span></div><div><span style=\"line-height: 1.4;\">&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=\"bold\"&gt;REASON 6: Weather and wireless interference.&lt;/span&gt; After your signals leave your location, they still have to fight their way through corruption caused by weather and electrical noise, forcing computers on either end of a connection to ask that damaged packets be re-sent.&lt;/p&gt;</span></div><div><span style=\"line-height: 1.4;\">&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=\"bold\"&gt;REASON 7: Traffic load.&lt;/span&gt; During parts of the day when more people are on the Internet, they create a usage spike that feeds a data traffic jam.

It got us where we wanted to go in cyberspace, but it was cantankerous and slow—slated for better things, to be sure, but at some time in the far, far future. And no one today could imagine what an enormous, pervasive effect the Internet is going…blah, blah, blah.&lt;/p&gt;</div><div>&lt;p&gt;The far future’s not as far off as it used to be. In just a few years, the Web has lost most symptoms of terminal crankiness. It’s turned out to be a bomb for tasks that would have seemed a natural. (Ordered any groceries online lately?) And it’s fulfilled other promises, but not in the way we expected. Previously, I wrote about the Web fulfilling the promise of Gutenberg, with everyone becoming a publisher. But I didn’t expect those “publications” to be called blogs or Tumblrs or Snapchats, nor that they would be as popular as they’ve become. Not long ago web designers were cautioned not to use graphics, music, animation—anything that would make the Internet cool—because they choked pokey Internet connections. Now we consume high-resolution photos, Flash animations, and even 4K streaming video as if it’s old hat. A decade or so ago, a couple of lawyers became nationally scorned by the pioneers of the Internet because they used the Web to advertise their practice—an obvious sacrilege. Today we don’t make purchases larger than a pack of gum without consulting the Internet’s consumer advice, sales, discount codes, and reviews by thousands of fellow consumers.&lt;/p&gt;</div><div>&lt;p&gt;The Web is changing how we do everything and creating new standards for commerce, education, and communication. Want to know how much something is worth? Go to eBay. It’s the ultimate free market, where the value of anything is quickly determined by a few bids that tell you—in real terms, not some economic gobbledygook—the most that anyone in the world would pay for a pair of Hulk hands signed by Mark Ruffalo.&lt;/p&gt;</div><div>&lt;p&gt;And then there is Google. Someone joked that Google is a god because it is omniscient and omnipresent. Religious issues aside, it has changed research, scholarship, and the settlement of bar bets around the world.

Not only are we creating more printouts than ever before, but computer printing has gained a third-dimension, with printers that can print functional three-dimensional objects. These &lt;span class=\"bold\"&gt;3D Printers&lt;/span&gt; may now be the domain of high-end labs and enthusiasts with cash to burn, but the day is coming when you’ll find one in every home, just like the inkjets and laser printers of today. And they’ll change everything.&lt;/p&gt;</div><div>&lt;p&gt;Whoever made that erroneous prediction about the end of printing missed an important fact. That person was probably thinking about how offices used paper in the age of the typewriter. Back then there wasn’t much you could put on paper except black letters and numbers—most often in an efficient but drab typeface called Courier. If all those ugly memos and letters had been replaced by electronic mail, the world would not have suffered a great loss. But what forecasters didn’t see is that software and printing technology would make possible fast, easy, graphic, and colorful hard copies of reports, newsletters, graphs, and, yes, company budgets and greeting cards, that even IBM’s best Selectric could never come close to producing.&lt;/p&gt;</div><div>&lt;p&gt;Speed and ease were the first improvements in printing. Whereas a simple typo on a typewriter might just be whited out or hand-corrected with a pen, today—because of the speed of printers—it’s easier just to correct a mistake onscreen and print a fresh, flawless copy. Graphics were the next big advance. The day of the all-text document ended with the first software that could print even the crudest line graph on a dot-matrix printer. Now anything that’s visual, from line art to a halftone photograph, can be printed on a standard office printer.&lt;/p&gt;</div><div>&lt;p&gt;That scenario has its evil twin. We often are so trusting of our computers ability to automatically remedy the mistakes in our lives, that a fresh, flawed copy comes out of the printer with such speed and cleanliness that it looks perfect. It’s almost unthinkable that in this beautiful, double-justified text in sleek Helvetica with a thin line between the main body of text and a perfectly-centered page number, there lurks an uncaught typo of the word “shiite.”&lt;/p&gt;</div><div>&lt;p&gt;The computer printer has opened the door to vast world of typefaces and typographical effects. Once the only way to give words emphasis was to underline them. Today, we can make words bold, italic, double-underlined, narrow-faced, heavy black faced, small caps, reversed, outlined, and dropcapped. Not only are we capable, sometimes we actually use them<span style=\"line-height: 25.2000007629395px;\">—</span><span style=\"line-height: 1.4;\">all of them</span><span style=\"line-height: 25.2000007629395px;\">—</span><span style=\"line-height: 1.4;\">in the same document. How can we help it? Laborious typing has turned into fun-filled laser printing.&lt;/p&gt;</span></div><div><span style=\"line-height: 1.4;\">&lt;p&gt;There are literally thousands of free typefaces today, where a 100 years ago there were but dozens at best, and most commercial printers had only a few of the costly molds for for those fonts in hot type. Now at no extra cost, we can give our documents comic book text, blood-dripping letters from posters for Resident Evil XIII, or type that tries to portray you as a person of such elegance that your business cards are printed with a beautiful but illegible script.&lt;/p&gt;</span></div><div><span style=\"line-height: 1.4;\">&lt;p&gt;Soon it was color, which began as an expensive luxury, but as the quality and speed of color printers increased, so too did the cost decrease. A $100 printer can copy a document, scan a photo for you to retouch, and then spit out the fixed version photo on high-quality photo paper, suitable for framing.&lt;/p&gt;</span></div><div><span style=\"line-height: 1.4;\">&lt;p&gt;Paper hasn’t disappeared from the office. Instead, it’s taken on a whole new importance. And the lowly printer that used to turn out crude approximations of characters is now one of the most important components of a computer system.

Regardless of how the dots are created, there must be a common method for determining where to place the dots. The most common schemes are bitmaps and outline fonts . Bitmapped fonts come in predefined sizes and weights. Outline fonts can, on the fly, be scaled and given special attributes, such as boldfacing and underlining. Each method has its advantages and disadvantages, depending on what type of output you want.&lt;/p&gt;</div><div>&lt;p&gt;Bitmapped images are the computer’s equivalent of Gutenberg’s type. Bitmaps generally are limited to text and are a fast way to produce a printed page that uses only a few type fonts. If the hard copy should include a graphic image in addition to bitmapped text, then, to create the graphic, your software must be able to send the printer instructions that it will understand.&lt;/p&gt;</div><div>&lt;p&gt;Outline, or vector fonts, are used with a page description language, such as Adobe Postscript or Microsoft TrueType, that treats everything on a page—even text—as a graphic. The text and graphics used by the software are converted to a series of commands that the printer’s page description language uses to determine where each dot is to be placed on a page. Page description languages are no longer so much slower than matrix printers. Outline fonts are more versatile at producing different sizes of type with different attributes or special effects, and they create more attractive results.

The other amazing thing about Gutenberg’s press is that it took 500 years for someone to come up with something better. As late as the 19th century, Mark Twain sank all the money he earned making people laugh into various machines to automate the assembly of type into rows of text. Or that’s what they were supposed to do if they worked.&lt;/p&gt;</div><div>&lt;p&gt;Why did it take 500 years to come up with something better? Because Gutenberg’s press was the evolutionary equivalent of the first fish that sprouted legs and decided to explore dry land on foot. Soon after that, for millions of years, feet were dominant. Every self-respecting creature had at least two. It was only when wings came along that animals had a different way to get places. Even then, walking still hasn’t gone out of style for millennia.&lt;/p&gt;</div><div>&lt;p&gt;You have to have fundamental evolutionary breakthroughs before you see inventions such as laser, inkjet, and 3D printers. The car isn’t a breakthrough invention; it’s a gradual evolution from the horse-drawn wagon. The interstate highways are currently the highest state of evolution in roadways, but there’s been no fundamental breakthrough in them since the earliest footpaths.&lt;/p&gt;</div><div>&lt;p&gt;Computing is a fundamental, evolutionary breakthrough. The first computer and the first transistor are not important because of what they were able to do at the time of their creation. They are important because they opened up a world of other inventions: streaming video and audio; topological weather forecasts; “big data” that allows us to look at people, nature, and society in a depth we’ve not had before. No one came up with a better way of printing for 500 years because technology builds for centuries on one tiny improvement after another until, suddenly, there’s something no one had imagined. No one created computing with the idea that it would design space ships, teach us languages, track our money, or even calculate how long we will live. If someone in, oh, 1944 had said, “I’m going to create something that will enable us to send pictures from here to China in a matter of seconds, and while it’s at it, translate a letter from English to Chinese,” that person would have been called crazy. (And he would have been.) There was nothing in 1944 to suggest to any sane person that all the things we take for granted today would ever be possible.&lt;/p&gt;</div><div>&lt;p&gt;The point of this is that we’re all in the same situation Gutenberg was. We’re just now seeing powerful, enabling technology emerge and swiftly change how we live as individuals and function as societies. Can you imagine what will be available 500 years from now?

It’s so fundamental that there’s a name for it: the &lt;span class=\"bold\"&gt;uncertainty principle&lt;/span&gt;. It goes something like this: It’s impossible to say where an atom’s electron is and how fast it’s moving at the same time. The act of observing the electron can only be done by bouncing some force off it, usually electromagnetic waves, and seeing what results you get. But when you bounce something off a particle in quantum-land, you’re nudging it one way or the other so that it’s no longer in the same place or traveling at the same speed.<span style=\"line-height: 25.2000007629395px;\">&lt;/p&gt;</span></div><div><span style=\"line-height: 25.2000007629395px;\">&lt;figure class=\"right\"&gt;</span></div><div><span style=\"line-height: 25.2000007629395px;\">&lt;img src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/HCW10/Images/23_-1/part07fig02.png\"/&gt;</span><span style=\"line-height: 25.2000007629395px;\"><br></span></div><div>&lt;figcaption&gt;Even a peek inside D-Wave's quantum computer provides little due as to how it works.&lt;/figcaption&gt;</div><div>&lt;/figure&gt;</div><div><span style=\"line-height: 25.2000007629395px;\">&lt;p&gt;</span>Quantum math says it could be anywhere—from gallivanting around a nucleus, as it’s supposed to do, to being imbedded deep within Saturn’s moon Titan. The best we can do is calculate the &lt;span class=\"bold\"&gt;probability&lt;/span&gt; of an electron being somewhere. (I’d guess Titan’s probability is on the low end, but I’m not a mathematician.) Microchips use the electron’s wayward ways to store data. Changing the charge in a transistor raises the probability that some electrons will wind up on the other side of a wall that the odds say they could not ordinarily pass through. No one says how they get there, but it’s probable enough that they do get there. When the charge is removed, the probability that they’ll pass back through the wall—back to where they started—nosedives. They’re trapped even if power is turned off, giving us flash memory.<span style=\"line-height: 25.2000007629395px;\">&lt;/p&gt;</span></div><div><span style=\"line-height: 25.2000007629395px;\">&lt;p&gt;</span>Another quantum property that could find its way into computers is &lt;span class=\"bold\"&gt;entanglement&lt;/span&gt;, or as Einstein called it, “spooky action at a distance.” Despite Einstein’s skepticism, scientists have verified that when two electrons become entangled—just how that happens varies—they instantaneously affect the state of each other even if they are separated by light years. If one electron is spinning clockwise and the other counterclockwise, changing the rotation of the first electron to counterclockwise results in the second electron reversing itself to spin clockwise.<span style=\"line-height: 25.2000007629395px;\">&lt;/p&gt;</span></div><div><span style=\"line-height: 25.2000007629395px;\">&lt;p&gt;</span>The immediate application of this spookiness is that it eliminates the time used by electricity or light to send information from one point to another. Spooky communications has already been demonstrated in a PC. Entanglement is in the same stage that radio waves were when they were first discovered; it took a while for radio waves to evolve into TV, satellite transmissions, mobile phones, radar, and garage door openers. Get to work, young graduate, on entanglement, before everything gets sorted out by someone else. Entanglement plays a role in the holy grail of quantum: the &lt;span class=\"bold\"&gt;quantum computer&lt;/span&gt;. Quantum computers do not use ordinary bits that have one of two values, 1 or 0. Instead they have &lt;span class=\"bold\"&gt;qubits&lt;/span&gt;, which can represent a 1, a 0, or a superposition of 1 and 0 so that the qubit can simultaneously represent 1, 0, and all the values in between. As the number of qubits in a computer increases, the number of superimposed values rises exponentially. This gives them the computing muscle to instantly create unbreakable codes and to solve complex problems. But a problem with qubits is finding out what their values are. Directly observing qubits effectively turns them into bits, and their wealth of potential data is lost.<span style=\"line-height: 25.2000007629395px;\">&lt;/p&gt;</span></div><div><span style=\"line-height: 25.2000007629395px;\">&lt;p&gt;</span>Researchers see entanglement as the tool to read quantum states. By entangling qubits so that one reflects the state of another, it’s possible to observe the state of a remote qubit to learn the value in a qubit back in the computer, without destroying the qubit’s special state. If, after reading that, you could use some ibuprofen, you’re not alone.<span style=\"line-height: 25.2000007629395px;\">&lt;/p&gt;</span></div><div><span style=\"line-height: 25.2000007629395px;\">&lt;p&gt;</span>As I’m writing this, there’s no word on whether this scenario for quantum computing will work. But a company named D-Wave Systems plans to have an operational quantum computer by 2015. There’s a lot of skepticism about that plan because no one outside DWave has been able to spend the time with the computer needed to test it. At the same time, no one doubts that someone at some time will come up with a quantum machine that works.<span style=\"line-height: 25.2000007629395px;\">&lt;/p&gt;</span></div><div><span style=\"line-height: 25.2000007629395px;\">&lt;h1&gt;</span>QUANTUM DOTS&lt;/h1&gt;</div><div><span style=\"line-height: 25.2000007629395px;\">&lt;img class=\"right\" src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/HCW10/Images/23_-1/part07fig03.png\"/&gt;</span><br></div><div>&lt;p&gt;So called because they’re small enough that they operate at the quantum physics stage, &lt;span class=\"bold\"&gt;quantum&lt;/span&gt; dots are created by bombarding a semiconductor material, such as silicon or cadmium selenide, with beams of atoms or ions that pound 100 to 1,000 atoms of the material into a single crystal a few nanometers wide.<span style=\"line-height: 25.2000007629395px;\">&lt;/p&gt;</span></div><div><span style=\"line-height: 25.2000007629395px;\">&lt;p&gt;</span>When a laser, or an ultraviolet or blue light—both of which carry more energy than other shades of the spectrum— strikes a quantum dot, the light’s photons energize the dot’s material, which expels the extra energy as a second light. The trick is that the dot doesn’t necessarily emit the color of light that it has been absorbing. The dot’s size determines now much energy it emits, which determines the color. The biggest quantum dots produce the shortest wavelength, creating red light. The smallest dots create shorter wavelengths, producing blue. In-between sizes put out the other colors in the spectrum.<span style=\"line-height: 25.2000007629395px;\">&lt;/p&gt;</span></div><div><span style=\"line-height: 25.2000007629395px;\">&lt;p&gt;</span>Even at the early stage in Q-dot development, its achievements and potential come shining through. In video displays, Q-dots increase the size of the color gamut—the range of colors a display can produce—by 40% to 50%. At the same time it uses 15% to 20% less electricity, furthering battery life in smartphones and tablets. Amazon’s Kindle Fire HDX 7 is the first tablet to burn bright with quantum dots, putting to shame Apple’s Retina displays on similarly sized tablets.<span style=\"line-height: 25.2000007629395px;\">&lt;/p&gt;</span></div><div><span style=\"line-height: 25.2000007629395px;\">&lt;figure class=\"left\"&gt;</span></div><div><span style=\"line-height: 25.2000007629395px;\">&lt;img src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/HCW10/Images/23_-1/part07fig04.png\"/&gt;</span><span style=\"line-height: 25.2000007629395px;\"><br></span></div><div><span style=\"line-height: 25.2000007629395px;\">&lt;figcaption&gt;The monitor on the left is juiced up with quantum dots for a greater gamut.&lt;/figcaption&gt;</span></div><div><span style=\"line-height: 25.2000007629395px;\">&lt;/figure&gt;</span></div><div><span style=\"line-height: 25.2000007629395px;\">&lt;p&gt;</span>That’s just for starters. Early work with quantum dots suggests they could replace transistors. And in quantum computers, which currently envision dealing with particles smaller than an atom, Q-dots could turn out to be a more manageable medium to work with.<span style=\"line-height: 25.2000007629395px;\">&lt;/p&gt;</span></div><div><span style=\"line-height: 25.2000007629395px;\">&lt;p&gt;</span>Expanding beyond the computing realm, quantum dots may one day save your life. Medical imaging has begun to use &lt;span class=\"bold\"&gt;colloidal&lt;/span&gt; (in liquid solution) quantum dots. Because quantum dots can be used in a fluid, they can become dyes. When joined with proteins that target specific cells, such as cancer, they literally light up diseased or malignant tissues. The photo below shows human red blood cells, in which specific membrane proteins are targeted and colorlabeled with quantum dots. In this case, the number of purple features, which indicate the nuclei of malaria parasites, increases as malaria development progresses.<span style=\"line-height: 25.2000007629395px;\">&lt;/p&gt;</span></div><div><span style=\"line-height: 25.2000007629395px;\">&lt;img src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/HCW10/Images/23_-1/part07fig05-h.png\"/&gt;</span><span style=\"line-height: 25.2000007629395px;\"><br></span></div><div><span style=\"line-height: 25.2000007629395px;\">&lt;h1&gt;</span>DEEP LEARNING&lt;/h1&gt;</div><div>&lt;p&gt;A few years ago, a list like this one would have included artificial intelligence. Today AI is becoming the new jet-pack, a clever idea in science fiction, but lacking in science fact. Most attempts at AI have involved writing complex rules for a computer to follow independently in complex situations.<span style=\"line-height: 25.2000007629395px;\">&lt;/p&gt;</span></div><div><span style=\"line-height: 25.2000007629395px;\">&lt;p&gt;</span>Why have none of them succeeded? First, think about how your intelligence was developed. You learned speech, how to walk, throw a ball, dance , and laugh at jokes, which are all intellectual skills involving interaction with the external world. But you didn’t learn those skills by anyone else telling you how to do them. (OK, dancing may be the exception, at least if you’re a white male in high school.) Most of the things we know and the skills we use came from assimilation. As infants and toddlers we heard our parents making sounds, so we attempted to do the same with our baby gurglings and sounds like “Ba-ba-ba-ba!” Eventually our brains recognized a pattern. Certain words were used around certain people, objects, and actions. It takes about two years for us to understand the fundamentals of speech, but we do it so naturally because the brain can’t easily communicate with others until it has learned language.<span style=\"line-height: 25.2000007629395px;\">&lt;/p&gt;</span></div><div><span style=\"line-height: 25.2000007629395px;\">&lt;figure class=\"left\"&gt;</span></div><div><span style=\"line-height: 25.2000007629395px;\">&lt;img src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/HCW10/Images/23_-1/part07fig06.png\"/&gt;</span><span style=\"line-height: 25.2000007629395px;\"><br></span></div><div><span style=\"line-height: 25.2000007629395px;\">&lt;figcaption&gt;This is what Google's deep learner decided were the proper generalized images for a human and a cat face.&lt;/figcaption&gt;</span></div><div>&lt;/figure&gt;</div><div><span style=\"line-height: 25.2000007629395px;\">&lt;p&gt;</span>Now some computer scientists are throwing away rule-based programs for a field called &lt;span class=\"bold\"&gt;deep learning&lt;/span&gt;. It lets computers learn on their own. Sort of. The computers do get some guidance and correction. But basically what deep learning uses are large numbers of processors and equally huge amounts of data to feed to those processors. Mention that combination and what leaps to mind is Google, which has plenty of both. And, in fact, Google’s on the forefront of deep learning.<span style=\"line-height: 25.2000007629395px;\">&lt;/p&gt;</span></div><div><span style=\"line-height: 25.2000007629395px;\">&lt;p&gt;</span>The fundamental concept is that billions of computer connections can work like the cortex’s billions of neurons. Google set up 16,000 processor cores and for three days showed the system 10 million images from randomly selected YouTube videos. If you’re familiar with Google and its YouTube service, then you know that many of those random images had to be of cats. The researchers did nothing to label cat images or define the concept of a cat, and yet the artificial neurons developed an ability to recognize not only cats but also flowers and human faces and body shapes with little outside prompting. Linking those images to one of 22,000 categories to choose from—some of which required handling such niceties as the difference between two types of skate fish—the network was accurate 15.8% of the time. That may not sound all that impressive, but it was a 70% improvement over the previous state-of-the-art system. And when the 22,000 categories were reduced to 1,000, accuracy was better than 50%. Google has already used the system to improve the speed recognition of Iris—Google’s Betty to Apple’s Veronica—Siri.<span style=\"line-height: 25.2000007629395px;\">&lt;/p&gt;</span></div><div><span style=\"line-height: 25.2000007629395px;\">&lt;p&gt;</span>All right. So you still wouldn’t put the system up against a Las Vegas blackjack table. It still has a way to go. But that’s the good news.

But spread the atoms into a thin sheet, and the electrons behave as if they are massless with particles moving through empty space at near the speed of light. And that makes for a different story.<span style=\"line-height: 25.2000007629395px;\">&lt;/p&gt;</span></div><div><span style=\"line-height: 25.2000007629395px;\">&lt;p&gt;</span><span style=\"line-height: 1.4;\">You have something that looks like a shadow you can pick up and hold.

It has two choices; nothing in between. If current passes through a transistor, the transistor stands for a 1, or if current doesn’t pass through it, it becomes a 0.

Not bad, but the processors in common use in 2014 and (spoiler alert!) for a long time into the future can juggle 64 bits with the ease of The Flying Karamazov Brothers throwing swords back and forth—and a lot more easily than the boys juggling 281,474,976,710,655 swords, the decimal equivalent of 64 bits.&lt;/p&gt;</div><div>&lt;p&gt;A processor being able to tackle more bits simultaneously doesn’t result only in bigger numbers.

With DDR, a handler could unload that same cargo when the train arrives in New York and then load it up with new cargo before the train makes its journey back to Chicago.

If you don’t feel like blowing money on a kid’s toy, pull some change out of your pocket. A dime, penny, nickel, quarter, half-dollar (if you can find one), and a dollar bill have a couple of things in common with the toy rings: None is the same size as any other, and they can be stacked.&lt;/p&gt;</div><div>&lt;p&gt;This is called the Towers of Hanoi Puzzle. It’s simple but tedious. All you have to do is move the complete stack of objects—rings, coins, plates, whatever— from their initial position, which I’ll call “A,” to one of two other spots, “B” and “C.” There are two rules:&lt;br/&gt;</div><div>&lt;span class=\"bold\"&gt;1)&lt;/span&gt; You can move only one object at a time&lt;/br&gt;</div><div>&lt;span class=\"bold\"&gt;2)&lt;/span&gt; You cannot place one object on an object smaller than the object you’re moving. For example, you can’t put a quarter on top of a dime.&lt;/p&gt;</div><div>&lt;p&gt;In the original, legendary version of the game, you must move 64 rings while following those rules. It doesn’t sound that complicated. And it’s not, really. Mathematicians have pointed out the similarities between the Towers of Hanoi and binary computations, geometry, and the exact duplication of a function called the binary carry sequence.&lt;/p&gt;</div><div>&lt;p&gt;But never mind all that. Let’s play the game using only three rings, or disks, as we’ve drawn them here:</div><div><span style=\"line-height: 1.4;\">&lt;img class=\"right\" src=\"</span>https://s3.amazonaws.com/HCW10/Images/3_0/0300_fig01.jpg<span style=\"line-height: 25.2000007629395px;\">\"/&gt;</span><br></div><div>&lt;ol&gt;</div><div>&nbsp; &nbsp;&lt;li&gt;Take the top, purple disk and place in the empty B spot.<span style=\"line-height: 1.4;\">&lt;/li&gt;</span></div><div>&nbsp; &nbsp;&lt;li&gt;Place the green disk on C.<span style=\"line-height: 1.4;\">&lt;/li&gt;</span></div><div>&nbsp; &nbsp;&lt;li&gt;Put the purple disk from position B and put it on top of the green disk.<span style=\"line-height: 1.4;\">&lt;/li&gt;</span></div><div>&nbsp; &nbsp;&lt;li&gt;Move the yellow disk from A to the B position.<span style=\"line-height: 1.4;\">&lt;/li&gt;</span></div><div>&nbsp; &nbsp;&lt;li&gt;Put the purple disk on the now empty position A.<span style=\"line-height: 1.4;\">&lt;/li&gt;</span></div><div>&nbsp; &nbsp;&lt;li&gt;Move the green disk on top of the yellow disk at B.<span style=\"line-height: 1.4;\">&lt;/li&gt;</span></div><div>&nbsp; &nbsp;&lt;li&gt;Move the purple disk to sit on the green disk.<span style=\"line-height: 1.4;\">&lt;/li&gt;</span></div><div>&lt;/ol&gt;</div><div>&lt;p&gt;There. In seven moves you’ve relocated three rings to a different spot. As you may have guessed, it gets more intricate as you move down through the stack—not more difficult, just more, and more, of the same. Add one more disk, and it takes 15 moves. Ten disks add 1,023 moves.&lt;/p&gt;</div><div>&lt;p&gt;The Towers of Hanoi Puzzle was discovered by French mathematician Edouard Lucas in 1883. A legend, possibly created by Lucas, has it that there is a temple with a room that contains three poles and 64 gold disks with holes in the centers. The priests at the temple are on a mission from God to move all the discs from one pole to another, Towers-of-Hanoi style. When they complete the task, the world will come to an end. Not to worry. The number of moves to complete the puzzle increases exponentially as the number of discs increases. If the priests could move one disc each second, it would take them 2&lt;span class=\"super\"&gt;64&lt;/span&gt;[ms]–1 seconds, or roughly 585 billion years, which is 127 times the age of the sun, to complete all the 18,446,744,073,709,551,615 moves required to finish the mission.&lt;/p&gt;</div><div>&lt;p&gt;This sort of mind-numbing task was made for computing. The &lt;span class=\"bold\"&gt;CPU&lt;/span&gt;, or &lt;span class=\"bold\"&gt;central processing unit&lt;/span&gt;, whether in a computer, a watch, a smartphone, or even a toaster oven plays its own version of the Towers of Hanoi. Like the moves in the puzzle, the methods used by processors work by doing the same thing many times. Multiplying 100 by 3,000 is accomplished by adding 3,000 a hundred times. Division consists of subtracting one number from another continuously until the result is 0 or the final number is not large enough to subtract the divisor from it.&lt;/p&gt;</div><div>&lt;p&gt;In the most powerful processors for PCs, the CPU can work with 64 bits at a time, but this doesn’t mean that in the monks’ full 65 ring game, a 64-bit computer could grab the first 64 disks and move them all at once. It still has to move only one tower ring with each tick of its internal clock, but the computer could simultaneously move one ring on 63 other towers. (A processor such as the Intel Core i7-965 Extreme Edition, with a clock speed of 3.20 gigahertz—3,200,000,000 ticks of the clock every second—could complete the monks’ original tower exercise in 13 day and four hours.)&lt;/p&gt;</div><div>&lt;p&gt;A processor is limited in the number of places it can put the binary numbers representing the bits while still carrying out its software’s instructions. After adding two numbers, the CPU might need to put the result in a part of the chip that acts as a temporary holding pen. After adding two more numbers, it retrieves the stored number to add it to the sum of the second addition. It’s kind of like how we humans scribble the result of some math operation on a slip of paper, so we can use it a minute later when we solve a related problem.&lt;/p&gt;</div><div>&lt;p&gt;Much is made of all the amazing things computing can do, but what it can’t do, so far, requires intuition, the ability to find a link among seemingly dissimilar ideas. When, in 1997, IBM’s Big Blue computer was the first machine to win a tournament with a reigning chess champion—Garry Kasparov—it did so by playing “what if.” What if it moved this piece, and then Kasparov moved that piece, and so on through six to eight moves starting from 20 or more contingencies. Big Blue was capable of 200 million positions a second. It’s much like doing the Towers of Hanoi—very fast. Human chess champions, on the other hand, say they uniformly avoid the what-if approach in favor of patterns. They will look at the board, and the years of experience buried in their brains see patterns of pieces that reveal a strategy to a win. Or, in Kasparov’s case, a loss.&lt;/p&gt;</div><div>&lt;/section&gt;</div><div><br></div>","type":"text",".priority":1}},"chapter":"3","number":"0","part":"1","title":"How a Little Microprocessor Does Big Things"},"3_1":{"cells":{"1":{"id":1,"text":"Few of us can do complex math in our heads.

And software really is magical. You invoke your computer—maybe with a touch, at the command of your voice, with the wink of an eye, or by pointing at a little picture with a mouse and clicking—and suddenly all these things begin to happen that could only be witchery. Beautiful color images and voices and sounds emanate from your PC. The software looks at a few numbers and predicts banana futures in three months. Ask your smartphone for information on a person, a country, or a date, and the phone responds like a crystal ball. You ask the software in a tablet to take you high in the clouds over someone’s home on the other side of the world, and you’re there in seconds—seconds! Magic carpets just can’t compete.&lt;/p&gt;<div>&lt;p&gt;Software’s abracadabra needn’t be a mystery to those of us who don’t speak VB, Java, C, C++, C#, PHP, and other curiously named software languages. It’s its own form of poetry. Within the words are hidden meanings, plots and subplots, forms more rigid than an iambic pentameter. And like a lot of ordinary poetry, it’s difficult for the layman to understand it all. We have to turn to the experts—the machines that read software.&lt;/p&gt;</div><div>&lt;p&gt;You’ve done just that. Before you bought your desktop PC, your iPad, or your Galaxy 5S, you had used software. Software doesn’t include only things like Word, Photoshop, and Angry Birds. Software is also music recordings and Blu-ray discs. Blueprints for building a dog house, a dress pattern, and a telephone number are &lt;span class=\"bold\"&gt;programs&lt;/span&gt;. A program is simply any set of instructions for an ordered series of actions. A program can exist as a printout of computer code or as a recipe in a cookbook. And you’re already a programmer, even if you’ve never touched a computer.&lt;/p&gt;</div><div>&lt;p&gt;Have you created a playlist of the best of Green Day? Have you set your DVR to record every episode of &lt;span class=\"italic\"&gt;The Daily Show&lt;/span&gt;, excepting the reruns? Have you entered the phone numbers of your contacts into your phone? Each time, you were programming. A program is simply a recipe, whether for Aunt Hattie’s chocolate pie or for how to calculate the paychecks for a thousand employees.&lt;/p&gt;</div><div>&lt;p&gt;There are, inevitably, layers of nuance. Think of what you do when you use a microwave. You press buttons in a certain order to make the microwave work at a specific power level for a certain length of time, then change to a different power level, and so on until your program produces a steaming hot beef stew. That’s programming—a set of instructions in a particular order—created on the fly. But if you press a button that’s preset for microwave popcorn, you’re using software—a preconfigured set of programming instructions that, in this case, are recorded permanently in a microchip inside the microwave.&lt;/p&gt;</div><div>&lt;p&gt;Hardware is capable of doing a variety of tasks, but without programming and software to control it, hardware can’t do much of anything. By itself, for example, a claw hammer is useful only as a paperweight, but used by a carpenter, it can drive nails, pull out old nails, and even crack walnuts. The carpenter swinging the hammer is programming it on the fly. A home entertainment center is a complex system of hardware capable of generating a variety of sights and sounds, but it can’t whisper a peep on its own. It needs software in the form of a disc, or a Roku video streamer, or at least a basic cable connection. The signals from the disc, the network connection, and cable tell the hardware what electrical pulses to use to re-create the sounds of Mahler’s Tenth Symphony or the sights of &lt;span class=\"italic\"&gt;The Avengers&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</div><div>&lt;h1&gt;Software of the Second Millennium&lt;/h1&gt;</div><div>&lt;figure class=\"right\"&gt;</div><div><span style=\"line-height: 1.4;\">&lt;img src=\"</span><span style=\"line-height: 1.4;\">https://s3.amazonaws.com/HCW10/Images/5_-1/part02fig01.png\"</span><span style=\"line-height: 25.2000007629395px;\">/&gt;</span></div><div><span style=\"line-height: 25.2000007629395px;\">&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;span class=\"bold\"&gt;</span>The Jacquard Loom&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In 1804, Joseph-Marie Jacquard programmed a weaving loom using a series of punched cards to form patterns in the fabric. Punch cards to enter data and instructions into computers were used well into the 20th century.&lt;/figcaption&gt;</div><div>&lt;/figure&gt;</div><div>&lt;p&gt;If you think of software as a recorded set of instructions that control the actions of a machine, then software’s really been around for quite some time. Music notation is written instructions for programming a piano on the fly. But if you have a player piano, the rolls of punched paper are its software. In the 18th century, weaving was done by someone manually slipping a bobbin wrapped with thread over and under other threads on a loom. The process was slow and rife with opportunities for slip-ups. But in 1804, Joseph-Marie Jacquard programmed a weaving loom using a series of &lt;span class=\"bold\"&gt;punched cards&lt;/span&gt; that controlled what patterns were woven into a fabric. Different cards resulted in different patterns. Jacquard’s invention is considered the birth of modern computer programming, and punch cards were used with computers well into the 20th century. The invention was also the occasion for the first wave of being scared by technology. In 1811, Ned Ludd, a Nottingham weaver who feared the new looms would replace people, led his co-workers in a frenzied attack on the machinery. &lt;span class=\"bold\"&gt;Luddite&lt;/span&gt; has come to mean any person who resists technology advancements.&lt;/p&gt;</div><div>&lt;p&gt;Software made little progress for the next century. In 1889, Thomas A. Edison invented the kinetoscope, a hardware device that let people view moving pictures on film. Film, sound recordings, and radio broadcasts—things we don’t normally think of as software—are, in fact, just that, and the most prevalent form of software in the first half of the 20th century.&lt;/p&gt;</div><div>&lt;p&gt;The first computers had neither a keyboard nor a monitor, and they had no software. Their creators programmed instructions by tediously flipping a series of switches in a precise arrangement. This set up a pattern of on and off electrical currents, and the computer in turn activated more electrical switches in the form of vacuum tubes. Finally, the result was displayed in the form of a panel of lights turned off or on to represent the zeroes and ones in the binary number system.&lt;/p&gt;</div><div>&lt;p&gt;John von Neumann in 1945 first proposed the idea of a general-purpose electronic &lt;span class=\"bold\"&gt;digital computer&lt;/span&gt; with a stored program. But the computer, the ENIAC, was not built until 1952. Meanwhile, scientists in England in 1948 created the Manchester Mark I, the first computer that could store a program electronically instead of making programmers set switches manually.&lt;/p&gt;</div><div>&lt;p&gt;During the next two decades, computers gained such accouterments as keyboards and displays. They used software in the form of punched cards, punched paper tape, and magnetic tape. All those forms of software were awkward and slow to use compared to modern software, but they made life much easier for early programmers.&lt;/p&gt;</div><div>&lt;p&gt;Not that there were many programmers back then to have easier lives. Some of the earliest writers of software sprang from a model railroad club at MIT. The railroaders used telephone switches to control their complex system of tracks, crossings, and rail switches. In the railroad, they had created a simple and very specialized form of computer. They already thought in terms of switches, the perfect training for writing software.&lt;/p&gt;</div><div>&lt;p&gt;Most of the software writing then was going on in the universities, military, and businesses that were big enough to afford the then room-filling computers, called &lt;span class=\"bold\"&gt;mainframes&lt;/span&gt;. But regardless of where different programs originated, in the 1960s they had one thing in common: They would work only on a specific computer for a specialized purpose. A program that was written, for example, to handle Gizmo Corp.’s payroll was customized specifically to match that company’s accounting practices and record keeping, and it would run only on a computer configured like the one at Gizmo Corp. If another company wanted a payroll program, it was written from the ground up again. And if a manager at Gizmo wanted to look at payroll information from a different angle, the entire program had to be altered.&lt;/p&gt;</div><div>&lt;figure class=\"left\"&gt;</div><div><span style=\"line-height: 1.4;\">&lt;img src=\"</span><span style=\"line-height: 25.2000007629395px;\">https://s3.amazonaws.com/HCW10/Images/5_-1/part02fig02.png\"</span><span style=\"line-height: 25.2000007629395px;\">/&gt;</span><br></div><div><span style=\"line-height: 25.2000007629395px;\">&lt;figcaption&gt;</span>Although a computer bug has come to be associated with faulty software, the bug from which the term derives its name was found in a computer’s mechanical relay, causing it to malfunction. It was taped into a logbook by Dr. Grace Hopper.&lt;/figcaption&gt;</div><div>&lt;/figure&gt;</div><div>&lt;p&gt;Programs back then had one other thing in common: They were either very expensive or free. Computer companies, such as IBM, saw software as a tool to sell hardware—”&lt;span class=\"bold\"&gt;big iron&lt;/span&gt;.” Because each program was a custom job—in a discipline that was still finding itself—companies expected to spend thousands of dollars. And compared to a computer that cost millions, a few thousand for software didn’t seem so bad.&lt;/p&gt;</div><div>&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, computer companies didn’t charge for an operating system—the crucial software that lets a computer run a program that performs specific applications. Think of an operating system as the producer of a movie. The producer doesn’t appear on screen. But that person works behind the scenes, hiring writers, directors and actors, finding and paying the hundreds of people responsible for building sets, lighting the scenes, driving stars to locations, and serving lunch—all so that the actors can do their best without having to worry about the hundreds of details that are essential to creating a blockbuster—or a flop.&lt;/p&gt;</div><div>&lt;p&gt;Early on, programmers routinely swapped their software code with other programmers. Many saw computers as more than business tools. Computers, somehow, were going to be the great equalizer. Information was going to be the next industrial revolution, and computers were going to give Joe Blow access to the same information available to the board of GM. Such idealism, joined with the fact that all programmers were really just in the learning stage, led to a philosophy that all software should be distributed for free. That ideal is still alive today in the open source movement, where powerful operating systems such as Linux are free and users are encouraged to make improvements for all to share.&lt;/p&gt;</div><div>&lt;p&gt;Gradually, the nature of software changed. Computer companies began unbundling software from hardware. A new working class—the “cowboy,” programmer for hire— traveled from company to company customizing programs and then moving on. In the mid-’60s, it occurred to some of these cowboys that they could write one program and sell it to several companies. A new industry was born.&lt;/p&gt;</div><div>&lt;h1&gt;Killer Software&lt;/h1&gt;</div><div>&lt;figure class=\"right\"&gt;</div><div><span style=\"line-height: 1.4;\">&lt;img src=\"</span><span style=\"line-height: 25.2000007629395px;\">https://s3.amazonaws.com/HCW10/Images/5_-1/part02fig03.png\"</span><span style=\"line-height: 25.2000007629395px;\">/&gt;</span><br></div><div><span style=\"line-height: 25.2000007629395px;\">&lt;figcaption&gt;</span>The first computer program, written in 1948 by Tom Kilburn for the Mark 1, was designed to find the highest proper factor of any number. The necessary divisions were done not by long division but by repeated subtractions. It took 52 minutes to solve the problem for the number 218.&lt;/figcaption&gt;</div><div>&lt;/figure&gt;</div><div>&lt;p&gt;When the personal computer came along, software followed a similar route. The users of the first personal computers—the Altair and the Commodore Pet—were pioneers who expected to do their own programming. They happily shared the coding tricks they learned and the programs they created. A revolution was in the making, although few realized it at the time. All the revolution needed as a spark was the “killer app.”&lt;/p&gt;</div><div>&lt;p&gt;A &lt;span class=\"bold\"&gt;killer app&lt;/span&gt; is an application program so useful and popular that it can create a demand for hardware. The first killer application for the personal computer was VisiCalc. An MIT graduate, Dan Bricklen, made one of those connections that change society. He saw that millions of accountants, business managers, executives, bankers, and stock brokers were wasting their time doing something a computer can do easier and faster: number crunching. Using mechanical adding machines, people were feeding in enormous strings of numbers and crunching them into other numbers. The possibilities for error were great. And the certainty of monotonous labor was greater.&lt;/p&gt;</div><div>&lt;p&gt;The result of Bricklen’s inspiration is the electronic spreadsheet, a killer application by definition because it was easily understood—at least by people who work with numbers—and in the time saved, it quickly paid for itself and a computer to run it on. On the monitor of the first truly mass-market computer, an Apple II, VisiCalc looked substantially like a paper ledger sheet. The hapless accountant still had to enter the numbers to be crunched by the computer, but he didn’t have to add, subtract, divide, multiply them or do it a second time to check his work. VisiCalc did that according to &lt;span class=\"bold; italic\"&gt;formulas&lt;/span&gt;—another type of program—which the computer user types into “cells,” those little rectangles created by the grid of a ledger’s lines. The formulas, of course, were created by humans, and there was always the possibility of human error. But after you got the formula right, you didn’t have to think about it again, and you didn’t have to worry about math mistakes. Just as importantly, you had to enter each relevant number only once. If a five percent sales tax was added to each purchase, the spreadsheet user had only to enter it once for VisiCalc to add the correct sales tax for each purchase.&lt;/p&gt;</div><div>&lt;p&gt;But it wasn’t only accuracy, speed, and ease that made VisiCalc so popular. It was also a matter of power, something business people understood even if they had only the vaguest idea of how these new electronic spreadsheets worked. Until VisiCalc, when a business manager wanted information about customers, sales, inventory, or budget, the manager had to send a request to the IS department, which would get around in the next few days to loading a program and data from huge spools of magnetic tape, letting it all churn for a while and then spitting out the information in the form of cards with holes in them or long streams of green-and-white striped paper. Wars have been fought in less time than it took most managers to get a budget projection.&lt;/p&gt;</div><div><span style=\"line-height: 1.4;\">&lt;figure class=\"left\"&gt;</span></div><div><span style=\"line-height: 1.4;\">&lt;img src=\"</span><span style=\"line-height: 25.2000007629395px;\">https://s3.amazonaws.com/HCW10/Images/5_-1/part02fig03b.png\"</span><span style=\"line-height: 25.2000007629395px;\">/&gt;</span><br></div><div><span style=\"line-height: 25.2000007629395px;\">&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;span class=\"bold\"&gt;</span>Lotus 1-2-3&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Lotus 1-2-3 was the first big business hit on the IBM PC because it combined the functions of an electronic spreadsheet, a database, and graphing. Courtesy of Lotus Corp.&lt;/figcaption&gt;</div><div>&lt;/figure&gt;</div><div>&lt;p&gt;The personal computer changed all that. Within a few minutes, any business person with a passable knowledge of algebra and some fortitude could crunch his own numbers. Knowledge was literally at his fingertips. And in modern commerce, knowledge was valuable. It was power. That power has increased exponentially as people find new and more varied ways to parse huge volumes of data. Facebook, for example, is built on that power.&lt;/p&gt;</div><div>&lt;p&gt;There was another lesson in VisiCalc. The software market was to become something so volatile, so innovative, and so important that no application remained top killer for long. When the IBM PC debuted in 1981, it could not run the software then available for the Apple. Bricklen’s company was slow in creating a version that would run on a PC. Before anyone knew it, the software scene was dominated by a new killer app—one that would run on a PC. The program was Lotus 1-2-3. Introduced in 1982, Lotus was, like VisiCalc, an electronic spreadsheet. But it expanded the definition of spreadsheets by adding capabilities for graphing the data in the spreadsheet and manipulating its information the way a database manager does. The use of graphics was particularly impressive for the IBM PC, which was designed basically to display only text. Lotus 1-2-3 justified the buying of IBM PCs and compatibles in many offices. It also revealed the perils at that time of buying IBM clones. 1-2-3 took advantage of some quirks in the IBM PC to speed up performance. But the same quirks weren’t duplicated in imitation IBM PCs, with the result that 1-2-3 wouldn’t work on some systems. Computer builders were forced to reproduce what they considered flaws in the IBM machine to be sure they could run any software the IBM PC could run.&lt;/p&gt;</div><div>&lt;p&gt;The 1980s were a decade of explosive growth—and often rapid death—of computer makers and software publishers. Software with eccentric names such as Electric Pencil and Volkswriter, both word processors, quickly expanded the capabilities of PCs. The early success of dBASE II, a database manager, inspired countless other programs with “base” in their names . Inevitably, someone created 4-5-6, which added more features to 1-2-3. Many programs filled in functions PCs were lacking. Peter Norton launched a series of products with Norton Unerase, capitalizing on the fact that the PC’s operating system neglected to provide a way to retrieve a file that had been deleted accidentally.&lt;/p&gt;</div><div>&lt;figure class=\"right\"&gt;</div><div><span style=\"line-height: 1.4;\">&lt;img src=\"</span><span style=\"line-height: 25.2000007629395px;\">https://s3.amazonaws.com/HCW10/Images/5_-1/part02fig04.png\"</span><span style=\"line-height: 25.2000007629395px;\">/&gt;</span><br></div><div><span style=\"line-height: 25.2000007629395px;\">&lt;figcaption&gt;</span>The first word processing program to make it to stardom was WordStar, a DOS-based text program notorious for shortcut keys, visible codes, hidden tricks, and the fact it could easily be modified.&lt;/figcaption&gt;</div><div>&lt;/figure&gt;</div><div>&lt;p&gt;At the same time commercial software was burgeoning into every possible niche, another software movement grew alongside the programs from big corporations. In 1982, Andrew Fluegleman created PC-Talk, a program allowing computer users to communicate over phone lines. Despite the name, you did not use PC-Talk by talking. Conversations were typed, but you could also transfer entire programs from one computer to another. The decisive feature of PC-Talk, however, was the fact you could get it for free, and it established an important category of software: &lt;span class=\"bold\"&gt;freeware&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</div><div>&lt;p&gt;In the years preceding the Internet, freeware programs were distributed without charge over electronic bulletin boards accessed with a modem and at the meetings of computer clubs called user groups. Often, freeware was totally free. Other &lt;span class=\"bold\"&gt;shareware&lt;/span&gt; gave you a chance to try the program risk free, but if you liked the software and continued to use it, you were expected to send some money to its author. At $5 to $40, the suggested prices were still cheap compared to software sold in boxes at stores. Some programmers humbly suggested users send whatever they thought the program was worth. Not unsurprisingly, a lot of people used the programs without paying. But enough people were honorable enough and enough shareware was good enough that at least a few programmers made respectable livings.&lt;/p&gt;</div><div>&lt;p&gt;The shareware tradition continues today on the World Wide Web, although now programs you download from the Internet are likely to have some features disabled or stop working after a month to encourage users to pay registration fees. Others, usually on mobile platforms like tablets and smartphones, give you free access to core features but force you to pay small &lt;span class=\"bold\"&gt;microtransactions&lt;/span&gt; to enable extended functions.&lt;/p&gt;</div><div>&lt;p&gt;The abundance of software in the early years also meant confusion. Many programmers had idiosyncratic concepts of what software should do and how it should do it. And they found equally idiosyncratic users. WordStar, for example, quickly dominated the word processor market despite a system for formatting documents based on starting lines with a period—hardly an intuitive approach. But WordStar could be modified by anyone with scant programming knowledge, a bit of daring, and a different idea of how a word processor should work.&lt;/p&gt;</div><div>&lt;h1&gt;Power to the Software&lt;/h1&gt;</div><div>&lt;p&gt;The dominating factor in the early software leaders was not that it came out of the box as an ideal product. Instead, programs like WordStar, 1-2-3, dBASE, and WordPerfect could be manipulated by non-programmers. This was the opposite extreme from the days of big iron, when a bright idea for a way to handle information had to be submitted to the computer pros, who would get around to it Real Soon Now. The factor distinguishing software from all the helpful tools invented before it was that software was malleable. You weren’t limited to using it as intended. One Lotus 1-2-3 user devised a way to use the number cruncher as a word processor. Users of WordPerfect routinely pressed the word processor’s mail merge functions into duty as a database manager.&lt;/p&gt;</div><div>&lt;p&gt;What really accounted for the popularity of the best software was the empowerment it gave people over computers. The best software came with macro or scripting capabilities that gave a layman user enormous control over this new machine. Macros let you record a series of keystrokes or write a list of simple commands for the software to follow. You made the software work the way you thought it should. You could create your own menus, fill in rows of information with a couple of keystrokes, or make your computer connect to a bulletin board service to download the latest games as you slept. There is a physical, Frankensteinian thrill to creating a macro or writing a script in and watching your computer obey your instructions like a faithful genie.&lt;/p&gt;</div><div>&lt;p&gt;There was, of course, despair as well as thrill. The truly insane greatness of the ’80s was as confusing as it was empowering. There was no master plan, no one person in charge of creating software. This often led to brilliant breakthroughs born of an individual spark of genius. But it also led to a new round of learning with each new program. In some programs, you might display a help screen by pressing Alt+H. Or Ctrl+H, or F7, or F1. It was an industry in desperate need of standards. (1-2-3’s F1 came to be accepted by other programs as the standard help key because of 1-2-3’s dominance and the universal need for help.)&lt;/p&gt;</div><div>&lt;p&gt;It wasn’t until Microsoft’s domination of the operating system—first with MS-DOS and then Windows—did some semblance of order contain the wild garden that software was throughout the 20th century.&lt;/p&gt;</div><div>&lt;h1&gt;Operating Systems and Other Software&lt;/h1&gt;</div><div>&lt;p&gt;There are basically two types of software: &lt;span class=\"bold\"&gt;operating systems&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span class=\"bold\"&gt;applications&lt;/span&gt;, regardless of whether your computer is a PC, Mac, iPad, Android tablet, or smartphone (applications are called “apps” in the mobile computing market, but that’s just shorthand.)&lt;/p&gt;</div><div>&lt;p&gt;An operating system is fundamentally different from all other types of software in that an operating system is the one program you must have to do anything with your computer. No computers need a word processing program or a spreadsheet or the game World of Warcraft just to work. But each computer must have an operating system.&lt;/p&gt;</div><div>&lt;p&gt;On its own, a computer can do little more when you turn it on than wake up and, like an infant, search for something to feed it. The food of computers is software, and the appetizer is always the operating system. When a computer boots, it only has enough code built into it to look on a disk or in chip memory for a few crucial operating system files. It pulls those into memory, and they in turn load the rest of the operating system. The loaded operating system establishes rules by which the computer can then load other programs and work with hardware that the computer isn’t smart enough to handle on its own.&lt;/p&gt;</div><div>&lt;figure class=\"right\"&gt;</div><div><span style=\"line-height: 1.4;\">&lt;img src=\"</span><span style=\"line-height: 25.2000007629395px;\">https://s3.amazonaws.com/HCW10/Images/5_-1/part02fig05.png\"</span><span style=\"line-height: 25.2000007629395px;\">/&gt;</span><br></div><div><span style=\"line-height: 25.2000007629395px;\">&lt;figcaption&gt;</span>OS/2 Operating System 2 (OS/2) began in 1983 as a joint project between Microsoft and IBM for high-end computers. Windows would be the operating system for entry-level PCs. Ten years later, the two companies let the joint development agreement expire. Windows and OS/2 competed for the same market, but OS/2 lost the numbers game. For the first time, a computer company other than IBM carried the standard to which other developers conformed.&lt;/figcaption&gt;</div><div>&lt;/figure&gt;</div><div>&lt;p&gt;The name for Microsoft’s DOS, for example, comes from disk operating system. Originally, DOS was designed as a software tool to create disk files, copy files, delete them, and organize them. All this was done by typing text commands on a black screen. More significantly, DOS let you run other software simply by typing the name of a program. Today Windows, Macs, tablets, and smartphones do the same thing with a click or tap on a tiny cartoon.&lt;/p&gt;</div><div>&lt;p&gt;If you look at the operating system as an office’s mid-level manager then applications are an office’s top executives. Like most executives, the applications have a lot of bright ideas but not the slightest clue about how to carry them out. But applications, like executives, have someone to do the real work. Applications give the OS some general, vague instructions—such as “Save this file with the name mybudget.” The operating system, in turn, passes more detailed instructions on to the office’s clerks, who are the ones who really get their hands dirty. In our little metaphor, the clerks are the computer codes contained in the BIOS, dynamic link libraries, and drivers. These are the people/code who know how the office actually runs—how to record a file or add two numbers.&lt;/p&gt;</div><div>&lt;h1&gt;The Devolution of the OS&lt;/h1&gt;</div><div>&lt;p&gt;If you’ve been using a PC long enough to know what a DOS prompt is, then you know that MS-DOS wasn’t designed to be easy to use. Actually, DOS was only one of two operating systems for the PC. Initially, IBM sold the PC with both Microsoft’s DOS and CP/M-86, an upgrade for the 8086 processor of CP/M (Control Program for Microcomputers). CP/M was a down-and-dirty operating system found on several brands of microcomputers at the time. Both DOS and CPM-86 were more concerned with providing a learning path that would be familiar to people who already knew CP/M, the original computer geeks.&lt;/p&gt;</div><div>&lt;p&gt;Microsoft and other companies realized early on that this shortcoming was a roadblock to more widespread user acceptance, and there were continual attempts on several fronts to improve or replace DOS with an operating system that extends the computer’s capabilities and makes it easier to use. Some operating systems, such as GEOS and DR DOS, gained cult followings but never had the market commitment needed to overtake Microsoft’s own evolving operating system.&lt;/p&gt;</div><div>&lt;p&gt;What an operating system needed more than bells and whistles—what it had to have—was the capability to run the thousands of programs that had already been developed under DOS. Software developers were loath to jump on any bandwagon unless they were sure the public would follow. Microsoft had the only working bandwagon in town. Almost.&lt;/p&gt;</div><div>&lt;p&gt;There was also Apple, which ran on its own proprietary operating system and had a strong, loyal market of students, graphic designers, and iconoclasts. And it had all the pretty little bells and whistles that seemed to make Macs so much easier to use than a computer that required users to memorize command words, along with &lt;span class=\"bold\"&gt;switches&lt;/span&gt;—letters or words typed in after the command word to control how a DOS function or an application carries out the command.&lt;/p&gt;</div><div>&lt;p&gt;Although there was a strong, loyal market for Mac computers the key factor in Apple’s success, apart from the charisma of Steve Jobs, was its &lt;span class=\"bold\"&gt;graphic user interface (GUI)&lt;/span&gt;, which let users make choices with their mouse by clicking small pictures called &lt;span class=\"bold\"&gt;icons&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</div><div>&lt;figure class=\"left\"&gt;</div><div><span style=\"line-height: 1.4;\">&lt;img src=\"</span><span style=\"line-height: 25.2000007629395px;\">https://s3.amazonaws.com/HCW10/Images/5_-1/part02fig06.png\"</span><span style=\"line-height: 25.2000007629395px;\">/&gt;</span><br></div><div><span style=\"line-height: 25.2000007629395px;\">&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;span class=\"bold\"&gt;</span>Windows 1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In 1985, Microsoft introduced Windows, a graphic interface that let you make selections with a mouse from menus and run more than one program at a time. It was slow, required major memory, and received a universal yawn.&lt;/figcaption&gt;</div><div>&lt;/figure&gt;</div><div>&lt;p&gt;When Microsoft’s own attempt at a graphic interface, Windows, first appeared in November 1985, it was slow, crash-prone, and demanded processing and memory resources that were then prohibitively expensive. It used graphics and a mouse pointer to do the jobs that required obscure typed commands in DOS. It was an unimaginative copycat of the Macintosh operating system. Still, Microsoft, better than any competitor, could guarantee that billions of dollars of software and business data already created under DOS would still be usable.&lt;/p&gt;</div><div>&lt;p&gt;Technically, Windows was at first an “operating environment,” window-dressing that hid the fact that DOS continued to do the dirty work behind the curtains. And the dirtiest of them all was running program code that was originally designed for the PC’s first processor, which could at best manipulate only 16 bits of data at a time. Many programs written for DOS depended on that 16-bit mechanism even after Intel introduced the 80386, which could process 32 bits of data at once. DOS, and even more recent Windows variants like Windows 95, 98, and Me, had to maintain parts of its own code that handled 16-bit operations. Microsoft did develop a variant of Windows—Windows NT, which became Windows 2000—that ran only 32-bit instructions. NT was a more stable variation of Windows, and it’s steadily evolved into the most common versions of Windows we use today, but at the time it couldn’t run older applications designed for older processors.&lt;/p&gt;</div><div>&lt;p&gt;Despite the deservedly cold reception Windows first received, Microsoft kept revising Windows until, with version 3.1 in June 1992, it had an operating system that, although still far from ideal and still tied down by 16-bit code, was fast enough and stable enough to convince the public and software publishers to hop on.&lt;/p&gt;</div><div>&lt;p&gt;In 2001, Windows finally made the big step. Microsoft updated its consumer-oriented OS to a fully 32-bit operating system, giving it speed, features, and security equal to that of Windows 2000. Some software creators still had to rewrite their programs to take advantage of the 32-operations, but for programs that clung to their 16-bit ways, Microsoft gave XP a “compatibility mode” that could still run the older programs. By the close of the decade, most of us had migrated to 64-bit versions of Microsoft’s operating systems, in Windows 7 and 8, that still maintain all of this backward compatibility while also attempting to bridge the gap to an ever-more-mobile world.&lt;/p&gt;</div><div>&lt;p&gt;There have been other operating systems, such as Linux, and non-Microsoft programming languages, such as Java, that were not a serious challenge to Windows—more like annoying gnats circling your head. Linux is a version of Unix, a geeky operating system for high-powered computers. Linux has gained popularity as an example of kumbaya software. It is free, and the underlying code is available to anyone. Other programmers are encouraged to make improvements to the code and share them with fellow Linux users. Linux has the idealism found in the earliest programmers who considered selling software for profit the equivalent of crossing over to the Dark Side. Programmers use Java, developed by Sun Microsystems to create nondenominational software. That is, a program written in Java runs on an IBM PC as well as a Mac or a Linux desktop. All those computers have to have is an &lt;span class=\"bold\"&gt;interpreter&lt;/span&gt; that looks at each line of code in a program and translates the command in each line into something that computer’s OS understands.&lt;/p&gt;</div><div>&lt;p&gt;Even with such competition, it looked for years as if Microsoft and Windows would continue to rule the marketplace. Other operating systems might have their fiefdoms, but Windows was king. And then the Internet became emperor.&lt;/p&gt;</div><div>&lt;p&gt;The Internet created a new space for programs to run, &lt;span class=\"bold\"&gt;clouds&lt;/span&gt; to store information, and ways for computers to communicate with each other and tap into vast storehouses of knowledge. Although Microsoft was looking to the big systems as the most likely threat to grind Windows under their heel, it has actually been little guys of commuting that have taken over and changed how we use computers.&lt;/p&gt;</div><div>&lt;p&gt;The little guys actually are little—the &lt;span class=\"bold\"&gt;tablet&lt;/span&gt; computers, &lt;span class=\"bold\"&gt;smartphones&lt;/span&gt;, which are really just portable computers that you can also use to make phone calls, and wearable computers such as smartwatches, Fitbits, and Google’s &lt;span class=\"bold\"&gt;Glass&lt;/span&gt;. Apple and Microsoft both have dogs in this fight, but the mutt that has exploded from the pack is an &lt;span class=\"bold\"&gt;Android&lt;/span&gt; and it comes from Google.&lt;/p&gt;</div><div>&lt;p&gt;In this part of the book, you first look at the programming languages that software developers use to create other software. You might never use programming languages, but understanding how a program is created can help explain some of the inexplicable eccentricities of your computer. Then you look at applications and how they do the heavy lifting that lets you run an ever-more-complex life just a little bit more simply.&lt;/p&gt;</div><div>&lt;/section&gt;</div>","type":"text",".priority":1}},"chapter":"5","number":"-1","part":"2","title":"Software — The Computer's Own Poetry"},"5_0":{"cells":{"1":{"id":1,"image":"","text":"<div><span style=\"line-height: 1.4;\">&lt;img class=\"center\" src=\"</span>https://s3.amazonaws.com/HCW10/Images/5_0/0500_thumbnail.png<span style=\"line-height: 1.4;\">\"</span><span style=\"line-height: 25.2000007629395px;\">/&gt;</span><br></div>&lt;section&gt;<div>&lt;p&gt;Our most fundamental tool as intelligent beings is language. It is through language that you learn new information and share your knowledge, feelings, and experiences with others. Through language, you can express any thought anyone has ever had and describe any event, real or fictional. The world is controlled through language. Presidents to petty functionaries, generals to GIs, CEOs to clerks—all rely on language to give instructions to others and to gather information.&lt;/p&gt;</div><div>&lt;p&gt;Language is a necessity for a computer, too. Software is created using special languages that provide instructions for telling the computer what to do. And language defines the data with which the instructions will work. Computer language is similar to human language in many ways. The nouns, verbs, prepositions, and objects found in English, for example, have their counterparts in programming code—or the source code, the actual lines of text that get translated into functioning programs. But software sentences have their own syntax, and the words that make up the languages have their own precise meanings.&lt;/p&gt;</div><div>&lt;p&gt;Computer language is more exacting and more limited than English. An often-repeated story tells how, in an early attempt to use a computer to translate English into Russian, the phrase “The spirit is willing, but the flesh is weak” was interpreted as “The vodka is ready, but the meat is rotten.” The story might be mythical, but it illustrates a reality—that computers and their languages do not do a good job of managing the ambiguities and shades of meaning in human language that any four-year-old understands (although advances in voice recognition have computers understanding what we say, if not what we mean).&lt;/p&gt;</div><div>&lt;p&gt;If programming languages lack the subtleties of human language, human language cannot match the precision of computer-speak. Try, for example, to describe a simple spiral without using your hands. It’s impossible in English. But because math is an integral part of computer languages, those languages cannot only describe a spiral but also can provide the instructions to create an image of that spiral on a display or printer.&lt;/p&gt;</div><div>&lt;h1&gt;Different Programming Languages&lt;/h1&gt;</div><div>&lt;p&gt;Just as there is more than one language for humans, so is there more than one computer language, even for the same type of computer. Generally, the various languages are described as low-level or high-level. The more a computer language resembles ordinary English, the higher its level. Lower-level languages are more difficult to work with, but they usually produce programs that are smaller and faster.&lt;/p&gt;</div><div>&lt;p&gt;On the lowest level is &lt;span class=\"bold\"&gt;machine language&lt;/span&gt;. This is a series of codes, represented by numbers (ones and zeros), used to communicate directly with the internal instructions of the PC’s microprocessor. Deciphering machine language code or writing it is as complex a task as one can tackle in computing. Luckily, we don’t have to do it. Programs called &lt;span class=\"bold\"&gt;interpreters&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span class=\"bold\"&gt;compilers&lt;/span&gt; translate commands written in higher-level languages into machine language. This chapter covers both interpreters and compilers.&lt;/p&gt;</div><div>&lt;p&gt;On a slightly higher level than machine language is &lt;span class=\"bold\"&gt;assembly language&lt;/span&gt;, or simply &lt;span class=\"bold\"&gt;assembly&lt;/span&gt;, which uses simple command words to supply step-by-step instructions for the processor to carry out. Assembly language directly manipulates the values contained in those memory scratch pads in the microprocessor called &lt;span class=\"bold\"&gt;registers&lt;/span&gt;. In machine language, the hexadecimal code 40 increases by one the value contained in the register named AX; assembly language uses the command INC AX to perform the same function. Although assembly language is more intelligible to humans than machine language codes, assembly is still more difficult to use than higher-level languages. Assembly remains popular among programmers, however, because it creates compact, fast code.&lt;/p&gt;</div><div>&lt;p&gt;On the high end, languages such as C and Java allow programmers to write in words and terms that more closely parallel English. And the programmer using these languages need not be concerned with such minutiae as registers. The C language is powerful and yet reasonably simple to write and understand. Currently, Java is the rising star among languages because a program written in Java runs on any computer no matter what the operating system. This is a distinct advantage when you’re writing programs people will use over the Internet, using anything from PCs to Macs and Sun workstations. Software written in C, in contrast, must be modified to allow a program written for one type of computer to be used on another.&lt;/p&gt;</div><div>&lt;p&gt;At the highest level are languages such as BASIC (Beginners All-purpose Symbolic Instruction Code), Visual Basic, the DOS batch language, and the macro languages used to automate applications such as Microsoft Office and Corel WordPerfect Office.&lt;/p&gt;</div><div>&lt;h1&gt;Software Construction&lt;/h1&gt;</div><div>&lt;p&gt;A program can be a single file—a record of data or program code saved to a disk drive. But generally, complex software consists of one file that contains a master program—the &lt;span class=\"bold\"&gt;kernel&lt;/span&gt;—surrounded by a collection of files that contain subprograms, or &lt;span class=\"bold\"&gt;routines&lt;/span&gt;. The kernel &lt;span class=\"bold\"&gt;calls&lt;/span&gt; the routines it needs to perform some task, such as display a dialog box or open a file. A routine can also call other routines in the same file, in another file that’s part of the program, or in files provided by Windows for common functions. Together, the kernel and subprograms give programs a way to receive, or input, information from the keyboard, memory, ports, and files, rules for handling that input data, and a way to send, or &lt;span class=\"bold\"&gt;output&lt;/span&gt;, information to the screen, memory, ports, and files.&lt;/p&gt;</div><div>&lt;p&gt;Typically, when a user types information into a program, it is stored as a &lt;span class=\"bold\"&gt;variable&lt;/span&gt;. As the term suggests, the information a variable stores varies from one instance to another. Programs on their own are also capable of storing in variables the information based on the results of a calculation or manipulation of data. For example , to assign the value 3 to a variable X, BASIC uses the command X = 3. Assembly language accomplishes the same thing by assigning the value to the AX register with the command MOV AX,3. Some languages require several commands to achieve the same effect another language accomplishes with a single command.&lt;/p&gt;</div><div>&lt;p&gt;After a program has information in a variable, it can manipulate it with commands that perform mathematical operations on numbers or parse text strings. &lt;span class=\"bold\"&gt;Parsing&lt;/span&gt; is the joining, deletion, or extraction of some of the text characters to use them elsewhere in the program. When a variable is text, it is often called a &lt;span class=\"bold\"&gt;string&lt;/span&gt;. You can have math strings, but most often, the term string refers to an uninterrupted series of alphanumeric and punctuation characters. Through parsing, a program can locate, for example, the spaces in the name “Phineas T. Fogg”; determine which parts of the string make up the first name, the middle initial, and the last name; and assign each segment to a separate variable. A typical math manipulation would be X = 2 + 2, which results in the variable X having the value 4. If that command is then followed by X = X + 1, the new value of X would be 5. The command X = “New” + “ “ + “York” assigns the string “New York” to variable X.&lt;/p&gt;</div><div>&lt;p&gt;Programs can rely on the BIOS (see Chapter 3, “How a Microprocessor Juggles Data”) to perform many of the input and output functions—such as recognizing keystrokes, displaying keystrokes onscreen, sending data through the parallel and serial ports, reading and writing to RAM, and reading and writing disk files. The programming language still must have commands to trigger the BIOS services. Consider the following series of BASIC commands:&lt;br/&gt;<span style=\"line-height: 1.4;\">&lt;span style=\"font-family : Courier;\"&gt;OPEN “FOO” FOR OUTPUT AS #1&lt;br/&gt;</span></div><div>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;WRITE #1, “This is some text.”&lt;br/&gt;</div><div>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;CLOSE #1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;<br></div><div>&lt;p&gt;These commands create a file named FOO that contains the text in quotes: This is some text. It then closes the file. The language Pascal does the same with these commands:&lt;br/&gt;</div><div>&lt;span style=\"font-family : Courier;\"&gt;Assign (TextVariable, “FOO”);&lt;br/&gt;</div><div>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;WriteLn (TextVariable, “This is some text.”);&lt;br/&gt;</div><div>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Close (TextVariable);&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;<br></div><div>&lt;p&gt;So far, I’ve described a fairly straightforward scheme: in, process, out. The reality is more complex. A program must be capable of performing different tasks under different circumstances—a feature that accounts for programming languages’ power and versatility. And because a program hardly ever proceeds in a straight line from start to finish, there are commands that tell the computer to &lt;span class=\"bold\"&gt;branch&lt;/span&gt; to different parts of the program to execute other commands. In BASIC, the command GOTO causes the execution to move to another part of the program. Assembly language does the same with the command JMP (short for jump).&lt;/p&gt;</div><div>&lt;p&gt;Branching is used in combination with the &lt;span class=\"bold\"&gt;Boolean logic&lt;/span&gt; functions of the programming languages. For example, when a program needs to change what it’s doing because a particular condition exists, it can use an “&lt;span class=\"bold\"&gt;if... then...&lt;/span&gt;” statement. The program checks to see whether a certain condition is true, and if it is, the program then performs a certain command. For example, if the variable State is the string “Texas,” the program uses the abbreviation TX to address a letter.&lt;/p&gt;</div><div>&lt;p&gt;So you get an idea of how programs are written, this chapter shows you a &lt;span class=\"bold\"&gt;flowchart&lt;/span&gt;—a kind of map sometimes used by programmers to lay out the logical connections among different sections of the program code. The example uses a type of game that was popular in the days when text-only adventures like Zork were plentiful. In such games, the user types in elementary commands, such as “Go east,” “Go north,” “Take knife,” and “Hit monster.” And the game displays a sentence describing the consequences of the player’s action. The example is oversimplified and takes into account only one small portion of such a game. As such, it gives you an idea of how many commands and how much programming logic go into even the simplest code. In the example adventure, the player is already on the balcony of a castle turret surrounded by Fire Demons….&lt;/p&gt;</div><div>&lt;/section&gt;</div>","type":"text",".priority":1}},"chapter":"5","number":"0","part":"2","title":"How Words Are Stitched into Programs"},"5_1":{"chapter":"5","number":"1","part":2,"title":"How a Program is a Roadmap"},"5_2":{"cells":{"1":{"id":1,"text":"Some software languages are like world leaders at a global conference.

Windows, OS X, UNIX, iOS, Android, and other operating systems exist only so you can run applications. The long definition of apps encompasses everything from first-person shooter games such as &lt;span class=\"italic\"&gt;Bioshock: Infinite&lt;/span&gt;, to the most strait-laced accounting program, to that app on your phone that tells you how many steps you’ve taken today.&lt;/p&gt;</span><div>&lt;p&gt;The lines between the operating system and apps have grown increasingly blurry in recent years, but there are still applications whose power and scope exceed anything that could be packed into an operating system.

Data can appear in the form of stock prices, addresses, money, dates, statistics, phone numbers, recipes, probabilities, dots of color, pages of text, notes of music, the number of lives left in a game, positions in a virtual world, or your longitude and latitude on Earth. Data are raw facts. Names are data, and so are the letters that make up the word “names.” Even computer code is considered data (which means data is manipulating data, a line of thought that is perilous to pursue). And all data are numbers, even if they’re words or colors.&lt;/p&gt;</div><div>&lt;p&gt;Computerdom has, by mutual consent, agreed on a standard called &lt;span class=\"bold\"&gt;ANSI (American National Standards Institute)&lt;/span&gt;. In ANSI, each letter of the alphabet, punctuation, numbers, and even an empty space is assigned an 8-bit binary number. Eight bits is enough to represent all the decimal numbers between 0 and 255. A capital “A” is 65. A capital “B” is 66. A lowercase “b” is 98. An @ symbol is 64. $ is 36. ? is 63. 1 is 49, and 49 is 52 followed by 57. (Another path better left untrampled.)&lt;/p&gt;</div><div>&lt;p&gt;All sounds can be expressed in numbers in the form of frequencies, amplitudes, and decibels. Your PC displays the colors on your screen by resorting to some combination of red, blue, and green—the only pure colors a display can create. With only 256 values representing 256 shades each of red, blue, and green, your monitor can produce more colors than most eyes can distinguish.&lt;/p&gt;</div><div>&lt;p&gt;No matter what kind of data you feed into a computer, the PC ultimately sees it only as numbers, strings of zeroes and ones written with transistors in the microchips of your motherboard. The decimal numbers of ANSI are converted to binary. A capital “A” becomes 01000001. A lowercase “b” is 01100010.

When we think of evolution, we think of the eons it took fish to emerge from the waters and walk, or crawl, or slither, or whatever they did to become full-fledged land lubbers. Dinosaurs dominated Earth for millennia before a giant asteroid hit and created the Gulf of Mexico, along with enough dirt and debris to envelope the world for years, cutting off the sunlight plants needed—the same plants the dinosaurs needed. The dying strains of dinosaurs gave earth its first birds, which evolved into the 10,000 species of little feathered dinosaurs we have today. Also among the survivors were &lt;span class=\"bold\"&gt;synapsids&lt;/span&gt;, creatures that, over 65 million years, evolved into the mammals we know today, including ourselves.&lt;/p&gt;</div><div>&lt;p&gt;Evolution is not limited to plants and animals. Non-living systems such as languages and societies evolve. Even rocks evolve. What begins as a layer of shells and bone left behind by deceased sea creatures experiences a few million years of pressure created by its own weight to turn into limestone. A few more million years of pressure morphs the limestone into marble. Still more years pass, and it turns into a bathroom countertop.&lt;/p&gt;</div><div>&lt;p&gt;The changes that rock undergoes might not qualify as true evolution because the concept of &lt;span class=\"bold\"&gt;survival of the fittest&lt;/span&gt; does not come into play. However, survival of the fittest does rule in the evolution of computers, where survival sometimes comes with a cutthroat viciousness that rivals any terrors of the Jurassic age. Evolutional changes may dawdle about for eons in the biological world, technological evolution comes with a swiftness that often brings the Next Big Thing before we’ve paid off the Previous Big Thing.&lt;/p&gt;</div><div>&lt;p&gt;The reason for the speed is that unlike the biological evolution, where changes in species, for better or worse, come from random, spontaneous mutations, evolutionary changes in technology come from conscious, deliberate decisions by inventors, engineers, software developers, and the wily, poison-spitting raptors of our age—marketeers. They are the trail bosses of guided evolution, making both minor and major changes on the fly, all to fight off attacks by rivals while still planning a safe and profitable route for their creations to follow a decade ahead.&lt;/p&gt;</div><div>&lt;p&gt;Just because there’s no directing intelligence in biological evolution, that doesn’t mean a planned, deliberate change in hardware and software always works the way it was envisioned, or that even if it does work, that it will turn out to be a good idea. Embellishing mice by putting a scroll wheel and buttons to navigate through web pages was a splendid idea—a survivor trait. Replacing the mouse, as someone really did about 20 years ago, with two foot pedals, one to move the cursor up and down and the other to move it sideways, was a terrible idea, and it became extinct faster than you can say &lt;span class=\"italics\"&gt;Galapagos&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</div><div>&lt;p&gt;That ridiculous mouse replacement was not alone. Extinction is the norm in technological development. When IBM launched its Personal Computer in 1987, it was an instant success because it had mutated small computers from toys for hobbyists into tools for business. Made from off-the-shelf components, it was affordable for those pining to have their own computers. But IBM’s strategy that laid bare the machine’s DNA led to a viral breakout of IBM clones. Within a few years, there were dozens of IBM imitations, some better, some cheaper, some both. The battle for survival was intense. The IBM PC was one of the non-survivors, although its ghost lives on at Lenovo, the Chinese company that bought rights to its laptop progeny. The chart on this page shows who today is at the top of the food chain.&lt;/p&gt;</div><div><span style=\"line-height: 25.2000007629395px;\">&lt;img class=\"right\" src=\"</span><span style=\"line-height: 25.2000007629395px;\">https://s3.amazonaws.com/HCW10/Images/9_-1/part03fig01.png</span><span style=\"line-height: 25.2000007629395px;\">\"/&gt;</span></div><div>&lt;p&gt;The initial eruption of PCs was followed by an aftershock of software. The first word processor to gain wide popularity was the cleverly named Electric Pencil, created for the Apple in 1976. Its fate should be a lesson to you that cleverness doesn’t take you all that far. By 1979 Electric Pencil had fallen to WordStar, whose power and versatility kept it on top until WordPerfect beat WordStar and 55 other word processors in 1986. Arguably, by me anyway, still the best word processor to crawl out of the program primeval. WordPerfect lost its dominance to Microsoft Word and Microsoft’s marketing muscle, proof that “fittest” can trump “best” in the battle for survival.&lt;/p&gt;</div><div>&lt;p&gt;WordPerfect is still a survivor, but a good rule of thumb is that any technology rises to the top only so it has a good spot to take a fall. (The big exceptions are Intel’s microprocessors, although &lt;span class=\"bold\"&gt;ARM processors&lt;/span&gt; are gaining as Android grows in popularity.) The electronic spreadsheet Visicalc which alone justified the purchase of millions of personal computers, is extinct, killed off by Lotus 1-2- 3, which fell in turn to Excel. The browser Internet Explorer pushed Netscape out of its cat-bird seat, but Explorer now has Firefox and Chrome gnawing at its heels. The small computer operating system CP/M was perfectly positioned to become the OS of choice on the new IBM PCs, but a simple twist of fate&lt;span class=\"super\"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt; gave that role to MS-DOS, which evolved into Windows, which is itself fast losing ground to Android in an increasingly mobile world.&lt;/p&gt;</div><div>&lt;p&gt;Today, the Internet is the massive asteroid that is changing the technological ecosystem by choking old tech and opening up fresh ranges for new tech. Although Windows is hardly an endangered species (yet), Google’s Android operating system thrives in the Web world, along with microprocessors designed for mobile computing. These are the beasts to watch. This part of How Computers Work is devoted to revealing the way that technology evolves, where it came from, and what it’s evolved into, without going into the shock and awe of marketing. Said marketing is influential but beyond the scope of a book bound with technology and steeped in physics rather than the fiscal.&lt;/p&gt;</div><div>&lt;/section&gt;</div><div><span style=\"font-family: 'Archivo Narrow', sans-serif; font-size: 19px; line-height: 29.9200000762939px;\">_____________</span><span style=\"line-height: 1.4;\"><br></span></div><div><span style=\"line-height: 1.4;\">&lt;footer&gt;</span><br></div><div>&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=\"super\"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt; Interesting sidelight: CP/M was the creation of the late Gary Kildall, and had no serious rivals in the pre-IBM PC microcomputer market. Naturally, IBM wanted to talk to Kildall about modifying CP/M to run on its new computer. But when IBM executives went to see him, Kildall was out of the office flying his plane. The person in charge, Kildall’s wife, Dorothy, didn’t like the non-disclosure agreements the IBM suits insisted on, and so IBM approached this other guy, Bill Gates, who had had a modest success with a programming language, BASIC.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;</div><div>&lt;p&gt;IBM asked Gates if he had an operating system that could be made to run with the Intel 8086 processor that would be the heart of their new computer. Gates knew that the fittest don’t survive by saying they can’t do something. So he told them, “Yes,” and quickly paid $50,000 to programmer Tim Patterson, who had developed an operating system adaptable to the 8086 with the name QDOS, for Quick and Dirty Operating System. (Really.) And the rest was not only history. It was survival.&lt;/p&gt;f</div><div>&lt;/footer&gt;</div><div><br></div>","type":"step",".priority":1}},"chapter":"9","number":"-1","part":"3","title":"What Makes a Computer a Computer"},"9_0":{"cells":{"1":{"id":1,"image":"","text":"<div><span style=\"line-height: 1.4;\">&lt;img class=\"center\" src=\"</span>https://s3.amazonaws.com/HCW10/Images/9_0/0900_thumbnail.png<span style=\"line-height: 1.4;\">\"</span><span style=\"line-height: 25.2000007629395px;\">/&gt;</span><br></div>&lt;section&gt;<div>&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=\"init-cap-words\"&gt;Just as&lt;/span&gt; we carbon-based units have an ancestry that began some hundreds of thousands of years ago, computing has an ancestry—not nearly as long, but just as important when it comes to understanding the workings of the digital machines we use today. Some of the nomenclature doesn’t make sense without knowing a word’s genealogy. Hard drives are so named because they evolved from something we rarely see today, a floppy drive. Why are CDs called “compact” discs? Because they are the offspring of video discs the size of LP-sized vinyl records.&lt;/p&gt;</div><div>&lt;p&gt;Random access memory (RAM) seems like an unnecessary term. First of all, it seems like it is memory designed for someone with attention deficit syndrome—someone who keeps flitting from data in memory one place to a totally unrelated data at another location. But RAM is more understandable when you know that before memory chips and floppy and hard drives, programs and data were usually stored on magnetic tape a lot like the tape in video cassettes (another fossil). Just as you couldn’t hop from the start to the middle of a video tape, computer users from the ancient days, who wanted some bit of data stored only at the end of a gigantic roll of magnetic tape, had to fast forward through hundreds of inches of tape to get what they were after.&lt;/p&gt;</div><div>&lt;p&gt;But DNA is not just nomenclature. Just like you don’t get an elephant without there first having been a mastodon, without many of the fossils of the premobilian era we wouldn’t have the kinds of computers, phones, TVs, tablets, printers, cars, medical devices— the list is endless—that we have today.&lt;/p&gt;</div><div>&lt;p&gt;When you look at some fossils, they seem so primitive you’re amazed anyone ever used them. The first modems sent text (only) over phone lines so slowly you could watch as e a c h &nbsp;c h a r a c t e r &nbsp;a p p e a r e d. But to those who never previously had the ability to send written messages on a phone line, the creeping words were just terrific! And without them, we wouldn’t have the Internet we have today.&lt;/p&gt;</div><div>&lt;p&gt;There’s another lesson to be learned by digging up digital bones: What inventions that today seem, well, kinda lame or too limited—such as 3D printers and 3D TV, voice recognition, artificial intelligence, and household robots—are most likely the future ancestors of technology about which our own carbon descendants will wonder how we ever got along without them.
